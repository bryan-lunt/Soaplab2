BatchTestClient
===============

Usage:
   build/run/run-batch-client -h[elp]
   build/run/run-batch-client <find-arguments> [options]

where:

  -h[elp]  ... print this help
  -q       ... quiet mode (useful when you want to redirect
               a result into a file)
  -stack   ... in case of any error it print the stact trace
               (without this option, it prints it only when a
                serious runtime error occures)

where <find-arguments> defines where to find all tested services
and what protocol to use to access them (some of these parameters may
also be specified in the Soaplab client configuration property file -
by default named soaplab.client.properties and put on the CLASSPATH):

   -protocol jaxws   ... service will be accessed as a Web Service,
                         using JAX-WS toolkit (default protocol)
   -protocol local   ... service will be accessed as local class
                         (no remote server or any Web Service used)
   -protocol axis1   ... service will be accessed as a Web Service,
                         using old Axis 1 toolkit (such protocol may
                         not be supported by the given Soaplab server)

   -host <host>      ... host name (default: localhost)
   -port <port>      ... port number (defaullt: 8080)
   -ctx <context>    ... context part of the URL (default: soaplab2)

   -e <url>          ... a full service URL (an endpoint);
                         if given it has precedence over -host, -port,
                         -ctx, and -name;
                         default is created from other parameters as:
                         http://<host>:<port>/<context>/services/<service>

   -lname <service>  ... a name of a list service to be called
                         (default   'AnalysisFactory' for axis1 protocol,
                          otherwise 'list')

   -el <url>         ... a full List service URL (an endpoint);
                         if given it has precedence over -host, -port, -ctx,
                         and -lname;
                         default is created from other parameters as:
                         http://<host>:<port>/<context>/services/<list-service>

and where options are (most of these options can be specified as properties
                       in the soaplab.client.properties file - but the
                       command-lien options take precedence):

   -batchfile <file> ... a file name with a list of services to be tested
                         (e.g. look into data/defaultTests.txt);

                         Default is taken from properties: batch.test.file

   -maxthreads <int> ... how many threads to se when testing more services:
                         0   ... as many as we have tested services,
                         1   ... test all services sequentially,
                         > 1 ... number of maximum tested services at once;

                         Default is taken from property batch.max.threads
                         (which is, by default, 25).

   -keep             ... do not remove jobs after they finished
                         (in this case, the job IDs are included in the
                          reports, so one can use them to retrieve results
                          using the regular Soaplab2 command-line client);

                         Default is taken from property batch.keep.results
                         (which is, by deafult, false).

   -table            ... produce a tabular output of all tests;

                         Default is taken from property batch.report.table
                         (which is, by deafult, true).
