TestSpinet - a simple testing tool
==================================

Spinet is a web-based interface to te Soaplab Web Services.
TestSpinet creates a single HTML page for a given Soaplab service.
Its main purpose is to test new stylesheets and jvascript options
without a need to deploy it to the Tomcat server after each change.

Usage:
   build/run/run-any-client org.soaplab.clients.TestSpinet -h[elp]
   build/run/run-any-client org.soaplab.clients.TestSpinet -name <service-name> [<options>]

where:

  -h[elp]  ... print this help
  -q       ... quiet mode (useful when you want to redirect
               a result into a file)
  -stack   ... in case of any error it print the stact trace
               (without this option, it prints it only when a
                serious runtime error occures)

where <service-name>
           is a mandatory argument defining for which service
           a panel will be created

and where other <options> are:

  -css <base-URL>
           a URL pointing to a directory with all necessary
           CSS stylesheets (stylesheet.css, supernote.css);
           it must used an HTTP protocol, not a local file;
           default: http://localhost/data/css/

  -js <base-URL>
           a URL pointing to a directory with all necessary
           javascripts (prototype.js, supernote.js, services.js);
           (it must used an HTTP protocol, not a local file)
           default: http://localhost/data/js/
