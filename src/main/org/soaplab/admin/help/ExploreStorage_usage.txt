Usage:
   build/run/run-any-client org.soaplab.admin.ExploreStorage [options]

where <options> are:

-h[elp]  ... print this help
-q       ... "quiet" (less verbose mode)
-stack   ... in case of any error it print the stact trace
             (without this option, it prints it only when a
              serious runtime error occures)

What persistent storage to explore
(only one option is used):
   -all  ... all available (default)
   -file ... file system storage
   -db   ... local database

By default, without any other options, it just shows
what persistent storages are available.

-l           ... list job IDs of all stored jobs
-run         ... create and run a testing job
                 (it sets testing results in storage(s))

Removing jobs from the storage(s):

   -clean <job-id>  ... remove given job
   -cleanall        ... remove all jobs

   -cleanlike <pattern>
      Remove jobs whose IDs contain given pattern.
      For example: -rp testing.helloworld

   -cleanfrom <from-date>
      Remove jobs updated after <from-date>. The format of
      <from-date> is 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'.

      Or, it can be a number (with or without a minus sign)
      meaning "last jobs for the given number". The number is
      in milliseconds unless it ends with one of the following
      characters: 's', 'm', 'h', 'd', 'w', or 'M'.

      Examples: -rf 2004-04-30 14:10:00
                -rf -20000
                -rf -3d
                -rf -4w

   -cleanto <to-date>
      Remove jobs updated before <to-date>. The format is
      the same as for <from-date>. For example:

      -f -2d -t -1d   ... jobs from a day before yesterday

Other options work only for a given job
(therefore, always with '-job' option):

-job <job-id>

-i   ... info about specified job
-ri  ... result info of the specified job

-r    <result-name>
      Show (or save in file(s)) the given result
      from the specified job
-sr   saves results (except 'report') to the current working directory
