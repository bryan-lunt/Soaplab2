<h1>Compatibility with Soaplab1</h1>

<img class="motto-img" src="images/motto-compatibility.jpg" border=0 align="left"/>

Soaplab2 is not that different from the previous Soaplab. Internally,
it is almost fully re-written but the main functionality
remains. Still, there are some changes. <p>

<p>


<a name="back"></a>
<h4>Backwards compatibility</h4>

Why do we bother? <p>

Mainly because of the <a href="http://taverna.sf.net">Taverna</a>
users. There may be some good workflows that will be still using the
Soaplab1 servers, definitely for some time. The backwards
compatibility allows the service provider to use the new Soaplab2
code, but still be compatible with these old workflows. <p>

In order to remain backwards compatible, the service provider has to
deploy her services using <em>axis1</em> protocol (details in the <a
href="Deployment.html">deployment guide</a>):

<pre class="script">
ant axis1deploy
</pre>

The Soaplab2 distribution includes a <a
href="copies/ConvertedEMBOSSTutorial.xml">workflow example</a> that
was successfully used with Soaplab2. It uses EMBOSS and
points to a server at http://localhost:8080 (so you can use it to test
your Soaplab2 installation if you have also EMBOSS installed). <p>

The only change needed in the workflow was a new name of few sequence
parameters (see details below) - but these parameters are not used
often so it hopefully do not break too many workflows. <p>


<a name="diff"></a>
<h4>What is different</h4>

Here are the changes that do not break anything. Simply speaking, the
Soaplab2 interface is a bit richer but if you do not need to use the
new richness you do not see any difference:

<ul>

  <li> In the <a
href="API/org/soaplab/share/Analysis.html"><tt>Analysis</tt></a>
interface (an interface representing any Soaplab2 service), there is a
new method <tt>getResultsInfo()</tt>. <p>

  <li> In the same interface, several time-characteristics methods
were removed (<tt>getCreated(), getStarted(), getEnded(),
getElapsed()</tt>). The same information is still available in the old
method <tt>getCharacteristics()</tt>. <p>

       This removal does not mean that you need to change your code if
you use the old methods. The Soaplab2 - its <em>axis1</em> layer -
makes these methods for you on-the-fly. <p>

  <li> In the same interface, all methods using <tt>java.util.Map</tt>
structure are using now a new, more specific, structure <a
href="API/org/soaplab/share/SoaplabMap.html"><tt>SoaplabMap</tt></a>. Again,
your code does not need to be changed, the Soaplab2 in the
<em>axis1</em> mode will provide the old Maps. <p>

  <li> In the <a
href="API/org/soaplab/share/AnalysisList.html"><tt>AnalysisList</tt></a>
interface (an interface representing a list of Soaplab2 services
provided by your server), there is a new method
<tt>getAvailableAnalysesWithDescription()</tt>. This method allows to
get all short descriptions without calling all services
individually. <p>

  <li> The major (but hidden) change is that Soaplab2 uses also other
protocols, by default SOAP/HTTP with the <em>document/literal</em>
flavour. <p>

</ul>

And there are few changes that <em>can</em> break clients code. But we
believe that most clients never used these Soaplab corners so not many
will be broken. Sorry for any inconvenience if you are the one with
the broken heart.

<ul>

  <li> The service metadata DTD has not changed - but the XML files
returned by the <tt>Analysis.describe()</tt> method may have some
options missing and some new added. This should affect only those
parsing directly the XML file. Those using the <tt>getInputSpec(),
getResultSpec(), getAnalysisType()</tt> methods should not be
affected. <p>

  <li> The EMBOSS names for so-called <em>associated qualifiers</em>
changed. This change definitely affects those programs and workflows
that are using parameters such as <tt>sbegin</tt> and <tt>send</tt>. <p>

       The new names are now created by putting together their old
name and the name of the parameter they are associated with. For
example, the <tt>edit.seqret</tt> service had before these input
names:

<pre class="code">
feature
firstonly
osformat
sbegin
send
sequence_direct_data
sequence_usa
sformat
slower
snucleotide
sprotein
sreverse
supper
</pre>

       Now it has these (the bold font is used to mark the difference):
       
<pre class="code">
feature
firstonly
osformat<b>_outseq</b>
sbegin<b>_sequence</b>
send<b>_sequence</b>
sequence_direct_data
sequence_usa
sformat<b>_sequence</b>
slower<b>_sequence</b>
snucleotide<b>_sequence</b>
sprotein<b>_sequence</b>
sreverse<b>_sequence</b>
supper<b>_sequence</b>
</pre>

       On the second thought, we may add some code that could accept
also the old names. Any need for it? <p>

</ul>
