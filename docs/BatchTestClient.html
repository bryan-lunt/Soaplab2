<h1>Batch-Test Client</h1>
<img class="motto-img" src="images/motto-batch-test-client.jpg" border=0 align="left"/>

<div> Soaplab2 services can be tested by calling many of them, or even
all of them, from a single client, in a batch mode, using a
pre-defined set of input data. They can be executed sequentially, or
in parallel. Obviously, this client hardly provide any scientifically
valuable results but can be used by service providers, or even by
Soaplab2 plug-in developers, to see that things have not changed to
the worse. <p>

In some scenarios, it can be, however, also useful for running
repeating jobs, because it can keep the results even after the batch
test client finished. </div>

<a name="structure"></a>
<h2> Structure of the testing input files </h2>

The batch test client can accept one or more <em>testing input
files</em>. Their format is a <a
href="ConfigurationGuide.html#pformat">properties file format</a>. The
property names are service names (with a prefix <pn>sn.</pn>) and
property values are the input data, specified in the same way as in
the <a href="CmdLineClient.html">Soaplab's main command-line
client</a>. For example (taken from the testing file for EMBOSS, the
full file is distributed with Soaplab2 in
<tt>data/embossTests.cfg</tt>):

<pre class="smallercode">
sn.alignment_consensus.cons=sequence_direct_data :${emboss.home}/share/EMBOSS/test/data/dna.msf
sn.alignment_consensus.megamerger=asequence_usa embl:AC073385 bsequence_usa embl:AP006749
sn.alignment_consensus.merger=asequence_usa embl:eclacy bsequence_usa embl:eclaca
sn.alignment_differences.diffseq=asequence_usa embl:ap000504 bsequence_usa embl:af129756
</pre>

The same service can be called several time, each time with different
input data (or even without any data, assuming there are some default
values). For example:

<pre class="smallercode">
sn.classic.helloworld
sn.classic.helloworld = greeting 'Ciao\, mundi'
</pre>

The example above also shows that commas in the input data <b>must</b>
be escaped - otherwise the value will be interpreted as two invocations
of the same service. <p>
 
The examples also show that the property values can contain another
properties (e.g. <pn>emboss.home</pn>) that will be substituted for
their real value before the property is used. Of course, the
referenced properties must be defined somewhere (either in the same
testing file, or, usually, in the <tt>soaplab.client.properties</tt>
file). <p>

Please notice that here, as in the <a
href="CmdLineClient.html">Soaplab's main command-line client</a>, one
can use the ":" character to indicate that the real input will be
actually read from the given file, and the "::" characters similarly
to indicate a <em>file of file names</em>. <p>

<a name="props"></a>
<h2> Run-time properties </h2>

The batch test client can be influenced by setting several run-time
properties in file <tt>soaplab.client.properties</tt>. Such file must
then appear in any directory on your CLASSPATH. Don't worry if you do
not know what the CLASSPATH is for. Just do one of the two things (the
second one is more recommended): <p>

<ul>

  <li> Put your properties in the template file
<tt>src/etc/config/soaplab.client.properties.template</tt> and run

<pre class="script">
ant config
</pre>

  <li> Or, put your properties into any file, for example the
<tt>testing.client.properties</tt>, and add a line to the file
<tt>build.properties</tt> (in the Soaplab2 main directory):

<pre class="code">
my.soaplab.client.properties = <em>testing.client.properties</em>
</pre>

       and then run:
<pre class="script">
ant config
</pre>

</ul><p>

The properties used by the batch test client:

<dl>
  <dt> <span class="hitt">batch.test.file</span>

  <dd> A file name with the <a href="#structure">testing input
data</a>. There can be more such properties, defining more testing
input files. Usually, these properties use a reference to another
property (e.g. <pn>base.dir</pn>):

<pre class="code">
test.data.dir = ${base.dir}/data
batch.test.file = ${base.dir}/data/defaultTests.cfg
batch.test.file = ${base.dir}/data/embossTests.cfg
batch.test.file = ${base.dir}/data/embassyTests.cfg
</pre>

  <dt> <span class="hitt">test.data.dir</span>

  <dd> Even though, generally, it is not a mandatory property, it is
used in the distributed testing files (files
<tt>data/*Tests.cfg</tt>). Therefore, if you wish to use them, you
need to set this property. Its value is a full path to a directory
<tt>data</tt> in the Soaplab project directory. <p>

  <dt> <span class="hitt">batch.max.threads</span>

  <dd> An integer defining maximum number of services invoked in
parallel. Its default value is 25. The too high number may cause
problem in your Tomcat server (the server has also its own maximum
number of threads which may be too low). <p>

       A value 1 causes that services will be called sequentially. A
value 0 causes that all services will be called at once, in
parallel. <p>

       
  <dt> <span class="hitt">batch.keep.results</span>

  <dd> A boolean property. Its true value causes that the results from
tested services will not be removed after the batch test client
finishes. In this case, the batch test client listing will also
include the <em>Job IDs</em> of the individual tested services that
can be used to retrieve the results (usually by the <a
href="CmdLineClient.html">Soaplab's main command-line client</a>). As
shown here:

<pre class="sscript">
[COMPLETED]   7_classic.helloworld <b>[classic.helloworld]43ab9197.117d16aa957.-7ffd</b>
[COMPLETED]  14_geocoding.geonames <b>[geocoding.geonames]43ab9197.117d16aa957.-7fff</b>
[COMPLETED]  13_geocoding.geonames <b>[geocoding.geonames]43ab9197.117d16aa957.-8000</b>
</pre>

       Default value is false. <p>

  <dt> <span class="hitt">batch.report.table</span>

  <dd> A boolean property. Its true value causes to list every tested
service with its elapsed time. See the <a href="#reports">reports</a>
below what else can be shown. <p>

       Default value is false (but the default template file
<tt>src/etc/config/soaplab.client.properties.template</tt> sets it to
true). <p>

<h2> How to run it </h2>

<h4>Quick start...</h4>

Without setting any run-time properties, without installing EMBOSS and
EMBASSY, just with all default settings, you can run it after you
deploy default Soaplab2 services by typing:

<pre class="script">
build/run/run-batch-client
</pre>

<h4>...and the rest</h4>

The batch test client is a command-line client. Its help page can be
displayed with the <tt>-help</tt> option:

<pre class="script">
build/run/run-batch-client -help
</pre>

<pre class="sscript">
BatchTestClient
===============

Usage:
   build/run/run-batch-client -h[elp]
   build/run/run-batch-client <find-arguments> [options]

where:

  -h[elp]  ... print this help
  -q       ... quiet mode (useful when you want to redirect
               a result into a file)
  -stack   ... in case of any error it print the stact trace
               (without this option, it prints it only when a
                serious runtime error occures)

where <find-arguments> defines where to find all tested services
and what protocol to use to access them (some of these parameters may
also be specified in the Soaplab client configuration property file -
by default named soaplab.client.properties and put on the CLASSPATH):

   -protocol jaxws   ... service will be accessed as a Web Service,
                         using JAX-WS toolkit (default protocol)
   -protocol local   ... service will be accessed as local class
                         (no remote server or any Web Service used)
   -protocol axis1   ... service will be accessed as a Web Service,
                         using old Axis 1 toolkit (such protocol may
                         not be supported by the given Soaplab server)

   -host <host>      ... host name (default: localhost)
   -port <port>      ... port number (defaullt: 8080)
   -ctx <context>    ... context part of the URL (default: soaplab2)

   -e <url>          ... a full service URL (an endpoint);
                         if given it has precedence over -host, -port,
                         -ctx, and -name;
                         default is created from other parameters as:
                         http://<host>:<port>/<context>/services/<service>

   -lname <service>  ... a name of a list service to be called
                         (default   'AnalysisFactory' for axis1 protocol,
                          otherwise 'list')

   -el <url>         ... a full List service URL (an endpoint);
                         if given it has precedence over -host, -port, -ctx,
                         and -lname;
                         default is created from other parameters as:
                         http://<host>:<port>/<context>/services/<list-service>

and where options are (most of these options can be specified as properties
                       in the soaplab.client.properties file - but the
                       command-lien options take precedence):

   -batchfile <file> ... a file name with a list of services to be tested
                         (e.g. look into data/defaultTests.txt);

                         Default is taken from properties: batch.test.file

   -maxthreads <int> ... how many threads to se when testing more services:
                         0   ... as many as we have tested services,
                         1   ... test all services sequentially,
                         > 1 ... number of maximum tested services at once;

                         Default is taken from property batch.max.threads
                         (which is, by default, 25).

   -keep             ... do not remove jobs after they finished
                         (in this case, the job IDs are included in the
                          reports, so one can use them to retrieve results
                          using the regular Soaplab2 command-line client);

                         Default is taken from property batch.keep.results
                         (which is, by deafult, false).

   -table            ... produce a tabular output of all tests;

                         Default is taken from property batch.report.table
                         (which is, by deafult, true).
</pre>

You can see that the command-line options can overwrite the run-time
properties described <a href="#props">above</a>. <p>

Soaplab2 comes with several predefined sets of testing input
data. They can be found in the <tt>data</tt> directory:

<dl>
  <dt class="indent"><tt>defaultTests.cfg</tt> is for default, more or less testing, services,
  <dt class="indent"><tt>embossTests.cfg</tt> is for those installing the EMBOSS package, and
  <dt class="indent"><tt>embassyTests.cfg</tt> is for those installing the EMBASSY package.
</dl><p>


<a name="reports"></a>
<h2> What is reported </h2>

The batch test client produces up to four sections of reports, in this
order:

<h4>Progress</h4>

<pre class="sscript">       
[Start ]                 39_alignment_local.water
[Start ]                 40_alignment_local.wordmatch
[COMPLETED]               8_classic.helloworld

[COMPLETED]             142_alignment_multiple.infoalign
</pre>
  
It reports when each service call starts and when it finishes. The
starts and completions are mixed together because the services are
called in parallel (in this example). <p>

This section can be avoid by the command-line option <tt>-q</tt> (as
"quiet"). <p>

<h4>All tests</h4>

<pre class="sscript">       
All tests
---------
classic.helloworld      0:00:00.443 COMPLETED
testing.sleep           0:00:02.431 COMPLETED
testing.sleep           0:00:03.581 COMPLETED
testing.streams         0:00:00.496 COMPLETED
testing.files           0:00:01.027 COMPLETED
geocoding.geonames      0:00:02.100 COMPLETED
classic.helloworld      0:00:00.250 COMPLETED
geocoding.geonames      0:00:02.289 COMPLETED
graphics.dot            0:00:01.101 COMPLETED
</pre>

It reports the elapsed time and completion status of all tested
services. It is created only if the command-line option
<tt>-table</tt> is present or if the run-time property
<pn>batch.report.table</pn> is set to true. <p>

<h4>Errors</h4>

<pre class="sscript">       
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ERROR: classic.helloworld
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unrecognized inputs: greetingXX Ciao, mundi
        Input:  greetingXX 'Ciao, mundi'
        Status: NOT STARTED
</pre>

This section is always produced (unless there are no errors) to the
standard error stream (so it can be redirected by using various shell
tools). It contains errors found either by Soaplab2 (as the example
above), or by the started underlying application itself. <p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<pre class="sscript">       
Summary
-------
Successfully:  8
Erroneously:   1
Not available: 0
</pre>

It is produced always to the standard output. The <em>Not
available</em> contains the number of services that appeared in the
testing input files but that are not available from the given Soaplab
server, at least not at the moment of running the batch test
client. <p>
