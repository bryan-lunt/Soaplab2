<h1>Using strongly typed services</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>One of the unique features of Soaplab is its generic interface that
makes it possible to use one single interface when accessing any
Soaplab Web Services regardless of the command line interface of
underlying programs. However it is not possible to specify
input/output data types as part of Soaplab generic WSDL; instead the
interface accommodates methods to query this information. This
difference from common WSDL interfaces, for example, doesn't allow
standard Web Services clients to check/validate input data before
sending a request or output data after a response has been
received. There was a growing concern in Bioinformatics Web Services
community that Soaplab should include input/output type descriptions
at WSDL level. To address this concern, starting with version 2.2,
Soaplab includes an interface called <em>typed interface</em>
(sometimes <em>typed services</em> that includes input output type
definitions at WSDL level. This document describes how to use such
services.</p>

<a name="wsdl"></a>
<h3>WSDL</h3>

<p>Currently, Soaplab does not provide any Java client library for
accessing the typed services; no equivalent of the class
<tt>org.soaplab.clients.SoaplabBaseClient</tt> that is used for
Soaplab regular services. Therefore, the typed services are used via
their WSDLs. After all, this was the main reason for having
typed services.</p>

<p>Each typed service has two WSDLs: one with and one without semantic
annotations. The semantic annotation is an W3C extension of the WSDL -
and it may (even should) be accepted by all tool kits and tools
consuming WSDLs. But in reality, there may be tools that are confused
by this extension. Therefore, you have a choice what WSDL to use. Here
is an example of a semantic annotation incorporated in a WSDL (the
example uses <a href="http://edamontology.sourceforge.net/"
target="_blank">EDAM ontology</a> for annotations):

<pre class="code">
...
&lt;portType name="diffseq"&gt;
  &lt;operation name="run"&gt;
    &lt;documentation&gt;starts a job and returns its job identifier&lt;/documentation&gt;
    <b>&lt;sawsdl:attrExtensions sawsdl:modelReference="http://purl.org/edam/operation/EDAM:0000256"/&gt;</b>
    &lt;input message="tns:run"/&gt;
    &lt;output message="tns:runResponse"/&gt;
  &lt;/operation&gt;
...
</pre>
</p>

<p>The URLs of the services' WSDLs are the same as service endpoints
with the suffix <tt>?wsdl</tt>, or, for semantically annotated WSDLs,
with the suffix <tt>.sa?wsdl</tt>. For example (using the default
host, port and context names):

<pre class="script">
http://localhost:8080/soaplab2/typed/services/alignment_differences.diffseq<b>?wsdl</b>
http://localhost:8080/soaplab2/typed/services/alignment_differences.diffseq<b>.sa?wsdl</b>
</pre>
</p>

<p>The <a href="SpinetClient.html">Spinet web interface</a> also
provides links to these WSDLs (right of the service names) - here is
an example:

<br clear="all"/>

</p>

<h3>How to use strongly typed services</h3>

Pickup your favorite toolkit, tool or programming language library and
feed it with a service WSDL. Here is an example of a Perl script that
calls an EMBOSS service <tt>edit.seqret</tt>, using Perl's modules
<tt>XML::Compile::SOAP11</tt> and <tt>XML::Compile::WSDL11</tt>:

<pre class="smallercode">
#!/usr/bin/perl

use warnings;
use strict;
use XML::Compile::SOAP11;
use XML::Compile::WSDL11;
use XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP;

# read WSDL, compile in into a client who will call the service
my $service_endpoint =
    'http://localhost:8080/soaplab2/typed/services/edit.seqret';
my $wsdl  = XML::LibXML-&gt;new-&gt;parse_file ($service_endpoint . '?wsdl');
my $proxy = XML::Compile::WSDL11-&gt;new ($wsdl);
foreach my $schema ( 1, 2, 3 ) {
    my $xsdXml =
	XML::LibXML-&gt;new-&gt;parse_file( $service_endpoint . '?xsd=' . $schema );
    if ($XML::Compile::SOAP::VERSION &lt; 2.0) {
	$proxy-&gt;schemas-&gt;importDefinitions ($xsdXml);
    } else {
	$proxy-&gt;importDefinitions ($xsdXml);
    }
}
my $call = $proxy-&gt;compileClient ('runAndWaitFor');

# prepare inputs
my $inputs = {
    sequence =&gt; { usa =&gt; 'asis:actttggg' }
};

# call the service
my ($answer, $trace) = $call-&gt;($inputs);

# check the response
die 'ERROR: ' . $answer-&gt;{Fault}-&gt;{'faultstring'} . "\n"
    if defined $answer and defined $answer-&gt;{Fault};
die "Sorry, no response from the service\n\n"
    unless defined $answer;

# print the results
for my $result (keys %{ $answer-&gt;{parameters} }) {
    print "$result:\n" . '=' x length ($result) . "=\n";
    print $answer-&gt;{parameters}-&gt;{$result};
    print "\n";
}
</pre>

<p>When executed, it prints the same results as a regular Soaplab service:

<pre class="script">

<!-- Mahmut, please uncomment the below when you re-deployed at EBI
with the new namespaces:

<p>You can try the same script and to invoke the same service at
EBI. Just change the service endpoint to
<tt>http://www.ebi.ac.uk/soaplab/typed/services/edit.seqret</tt>. </p>
