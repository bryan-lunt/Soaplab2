Some requirements may differ depending on how and where you <a
href="Download.html">got Soaplab from</a>. But most requirements are
universal. <p>

<ul>
  <li> <span class="subtitle">Operating system, platform</span><p>
       
       Soaplab2 should work on any platform because it is written in
Java. But keep it mind that Soaplab is just a Web Services gateway to
the analysis tools (such as <a
href="http://emboss.sourceforge.net/">EMBOSS</a>) that you wish to
provide. These tools need also to be runnable on the same machine
where you install Soaplab2. <p>

  <li> <span class="subtitle">Java</span><p>
       
       Install <a
href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">JDK Java 1.5 or
later</a>. <p>

  <li> <span class="subtitle">Apache Tomcat</span> (or a similar servlet container)<p>
       
       Soaplab2 is about Web Services - and Web Services are web
applications run in a servlet container. The development of Soaplab2
was mostly done by using the <a
href="http://tomcat.apache.org/download-55.cgi">Apache Tomcat
5</a>. But other container should work, as well. <p>

  <li> <span class="subtitle">Apache Ant</span><p>
       
       The Ant is a Java tool for building, executing and playing with
Java (and perhaps other, as well) programs. Soaplab2, as most of any
Java programs, uses it a lot. <p>

  <li> <em>Optionally:</em><p>

       <ul>
	 <li class="tiny"> mySQL database for storing analysis results<p>

	 In the time of writing this, however, the Soaplab2 beta
version does not have yet support for mySQL. <p>

	 <li class="tiny"> Perl<p>

	 In the time of writing this, the Soaplab2 beta version still
uses Perl for converting ACD files (those describing analyses that
will be provided as Web Services) to XML files. The Perl is, however,
not used when the services are run. <p>

	 Also, Soaplab2 is distributed with few testing "analysis"
(like echoing command line parameters, or copying input file to an
output file) - and those are written in Perl. <p>

       </ul>
</ul>
