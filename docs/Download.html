<h1>Where to get Soaplab2 from</h1>
<p>

<img class="motto-img" src="images/motto-download.jpg" border=0 align="left"/>

Soaplab2 is distributed in several ways. Pick up the one that suits
your needs, skills and courage. As always with Soaplab, different
types of users (service providers, developers, Taverna users) may have
different requirements and expectations. <p>

<br clear="all"/>

<div class="doctoc">
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="#cvs">Soaplab2 from the CVS</a>
  <dt> <a href="#export">Soaplab2 from a released distribution</a>
<!--  <dt> <a href="#war">Pre-packed sets of Soaplab2 services</a> -->
  <dt> <a href="#maven">Soaplab2 from a Maven repository</a>
</dl> <p>
</div>
<p>

If you want to have everything (including sources), and always the
latest version (with more bugs fixed, and perhaps new bugs
introduced), take Soaplab2 form the CVS:

<a name="cvs"></a>
<h3>Soaplab2 from the CVS</h3>

<div class="reqs">
<u><a href="Requirements.html">Requirements:</a></u>
CVS client,
Java (JDK),
Apache Ant,
Apache Tomcat,
<em>Perl</em>
</div><p>


Soaplab2 is available at <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/soaplab/">SourceForge</a> in the
<a href="http://soaplab.cvs.sourceforge.net/soaplab/soaplab2/">CVS
module <b>soaplab2</b></a>. <p>

Use a CVS client to check it out anonymously from SourceForge. For
example, to use the command-line CVS client, type:

<pre class="script">
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@soaplab.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/soaplab login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@soaplab.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/soaplab co -P soaplab2
</pre>

When prompted for a password, simply press the Enter key.<p>

Anytime later, you can update it by typing:

<pre class="script">
cd soaplab2
cvs update -dP
</pre>

Once you have, or once you update it, go and <a
href="BuildGuide.html">build</a> it. <p>




<a name="export"></a>
<h3>Soaplab2 from a released distribution</h3>

<div class="reqs">
<u><a href="Requirements.html">Requirements:</a></u>
Java (JDK),
Apache Ant,
Apache Tomcat,
<em>Perl</em>
</div><p>

Time to time, Soaplab2 releases stable versions on the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=104834">SourceForge
download page</a>. They are similar to the CVS distribution with the
following differences:

<ul>

  <li class="tiny">

  A release is a snapshot in one time point. It was not updated since
it was released. Which brings more stability but also you may miss
some new fixes and features. <p>

  
  <li class="tiny">

  You cannot update this release automatically, you need to download a
new release and re-install it (which is, however, not a big deal). <p>


  <li class="tiny">

  You do not need a CVS client installed on your machine. <p>

  
</ul><p>


<!--
<a name="war"></a
<h3>Pre-packed sets of Soaplab2 services</h3>

<div class="reqs">
<u><a href="Requirements.html">Requirements:</a></u>
Java (JDK),
Apache Tomcat,
</div><p>

This is the fastest way how to start providing Soaplab2 services from
your server(s). The <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=104834">SourceForge
download page</a> has several pre-packed <em>war files</em> that contain
everything to run a set of Soaplab2 Web Services (well, almost
everything, see below). <p>

You just have to put a selected <em>war file</em> into your Tomcat
installation (in the <tt>&lt;tomcat-home&gt;/webapps</tt>
directory). Tomcat even does not need to be restarted; after a moment
it spots the new war file, unpacks it, and starts using it. <p>

You can also use your Tomcat manager to upload a <em>war file</em>
directly from SourceForge to your Tomcat (here is a brief note <a
href="Deployment.html#tomcat-manager">how to enable Tomcat
manager</a>). <p>

Often, the pre-packed service sets need to know about your
environment. For example, the service pack with EMBOSS services needs
to know where is your EMBOSS installed. You have to manually edit the
file
<tt>&lt;tomcat-home&gt;/webapps/soaplab2/WEB-INF/classes/soaplab.properties</tt>. Or,
you can download the war file, unpacked it (using the Java's tool
<em>jar</em>, edit the <tt>soaplab.properties</tt>, pack it again, and
upload it to your Tomcat. In any case, check the notes accompanying
the <em>war files</em> releases, which properties are expected to be
set (usually very little, often just one property). A general
description how to set Soaplab's properties and what they mean is in
the <a href="ConfigurationGuide.html">configuration guide</a>. <p>

<a name="maven"></a>
<h3>Soaplab2 from a Maven repository</h3>

<div class="reqs">
<u><a href="Requirements.html">Requirements:</a></u>
Java (JDK or JRE)
</div><p>

Maven repositories are for developers of Soaplab2 add-ons, or for
those running Soaplab2 as a part of a bigger project. Typical example
of the latter is <a href="http://taverna.sf.net">Taverna</a>. <p>

The advantage of the Maven repository is that it knows about all
third-party dependencies that are needed by Soaplab2. <p>

The Soaplab2 is in the <a href="http://biomoby.org/m2repo/">Open-Bio
Maven repository</a>:

<pre class="script">
  &lt;repository&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;bio.maven.repository&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;url&gt;http://biomoby.org/m2repo/&lt;/url&gt;
  &lt;/repository&gt;
</pre>

and you put Soaplab2 in your dependency file using (use the version
number you wish):

<pre class="script">
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.soaplab&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;soaplab&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;2.0.0-beta1&lt;/version&gt;
</pre>
