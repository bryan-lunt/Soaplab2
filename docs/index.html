<h1>Soaplab2</h1>

Soaplab2 is a refactoring and enhancement of a long-standing project
<a href="http://soaplab.sourceforge.net/soaplab1/">Soaplab</a> (that
is still being used and maintained). Please check the details of the
aims and reasons of the project on its original <a
href="http://soaplab.sourceforge.net/soaplab1/">Soaplab pages</a>
until this Soaplab2 documentation is finished. The main reasons for
Soaplab2 were captured in <a href="announcement-email.html">this
email</a>. <p>


Soaplab2 (or Soaplab) is a tool that can automatically generate and
deploy Web Services on top of existing command-line analysis
programs. It is especially well suited for applications with well
described input and output parameters, such as <a
href="http://emboss.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">EMBOSS</a> (a
package of Open Source software for sequence analysis). Soaplab allows
integration of many applications within a single programming
interface. <p>

Soaplab can also interoperate with other Web Services and can create
Web Services on top of existing web resources (e.g. extracting data
from a third-party web page and providing its data as a Web Service) -
a sub-project called <em>Gowlab</em>. [ An old documentation available
<a
href="http://soaplab.sourceforge.net/soaplab1/Gowlab.html">here</a>. ]
<p>

<h3>What Soaplab solves</h3>

An <b>executive summary</b> who can benefit from using Soaplab can be
expressed in three following questions. If you answer them
affirmatively then Soaplab can help you: <p>

<ol>
  <li> You have (or someone else has) one or more <b>command-line
       programs</b> (analysis tools) to offer
  <li> You wish to access them from other computers, eventually over
       the Internet
  <li> You wish to access them using your (or someone else)
       client programs, not just by filling the forms and clicking on
       web pages manually
</ol> <p>

Also, Soaplab will work for you with the modified first question:
You wish to grab (screen-scrape) data from a web page (more about this
in the <em>Gowlab</em> sub-project).<p>

You <em>do not need to be a programmer</em> in order to benefit from
Soaplab. Soaplab generates everything needed for creating and
running your Web services from description files (which you <em>have
to create</em>).<p>

<h3>Acknowledgment</h3>

Even thought the work on Soaplab2 is still driven by Martin Senger,
the original Soaplab author, any progress would be impossible
without the help of others: <p>

Peter Rice's group at <a
href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Rice/">European Bioinformatics
Institute</a> is the major driving force. Especially thanks to Mahmut
Uludag, Alan Bleasby, Jon Ison, and Tom Oinn (you know <a
href="http://taverna.sourceforge.net/">Taverna</a>, don't you?). <p>

Equally helpful is Peter Ernst from the Sandor Suhai's group at <a
href="http://genome.dkfz-heidelberg.de/">German Cancer Research
Center</a>. Sebastien Moretti from University of Lausanne was helpful
with testing and maintenance of batch test sets.<p>

The funding and support come from various sources, depending mostly on
the individuals involved. The significant contribution, especially in
2007, came from the <a href="http://www.irri.org">International Rice
Research Institute</a> (including the <a
href="http://www.generationcp.org/">Generation Challenge
Programme</a>), and from the <a
href="http://www.bioinfogrid.eu/">BioinfoGRID project</a>.
Project was also supported by the European Comission through the 
<a href="http://www.embracegrid.info/">EMBRACE Network of Excellence</a>
by its funding for the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/soaplab/">EBI
Soaplab Web Services</a>.<p>

The tooltips library used in the <a href="SpinetClient.html">Spinet
client</a> is credited to <a href="http://www.twinhelix.com">TwinHelix
Designs</a>. Most of the icons in the <em>Spinet</em> client were
shamelessly stolen from the open-source project <a
href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>. <p>

The documents icons were created at <a
href="http://www.glassgiant.com/">GlassGiant.com</a>. <p>
