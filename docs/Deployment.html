<h1>Deploying Soaplab2 services</h1>

<img class="motto-img" src="images/motto-deploying-services.jpg" border=0 align="left"/>

Deploying Web services means to move all necessary files to your
servlet container (usually a Tomcat server), and to configure how they
should be used when requests for services are coming. <p>

It sounds easy and obvious - but it never is. Soaplab2 tries hard,
hopefully, to make it easy at least for the default cases. <p>

<a name="protocols"></a>
<h2>Supported protocols for Soaplab2 services</h2>

The Web Services can be (unfortunately) accessed using several various
protocols, or several flavours of the same SOAP protocol. The chosen
protocol also determines what Java toolkit can be used (not every
toolkit has support for every protocol). <p>

The Soaplab2 <a
href="DevelopersGuide.html#architecture">architecture</a> is flexible
enough to allow several protocols. At the moment, the main protocol is
the SOAP protocol, using the <em>document/literal</em> flavour. It is
one of the three [<em>sic</em>] standarised flavours. This protocol is
also well supported in Java, up to the point that the toolkit is now
part of the Java 1.6. (Unfortunately, it is much less supported in
other languages, yet.) <p>

Reflecting the name of the Java toolkit (<em>JAX-WS</em>), we are
referring to this protocol as a <em>jax</em> or <em>jaxws</em>
protocol. It is a default one for deploying Soaplab2 services. <p>

Mainly because of the backward compatibility with the previous
versions of Soaplab (more about it in the <a
href="Compatibility.html">compatibility guide</a>), Soaplab2 also
supports the SOAP protocol, using the <em>rpc/encoded</em>
flavour. Again reflecting the major Java toolkit for this flavour, we
refer to is as <em>axis1</em> protocol. <p>

<div class="note">

It would be relatively easy to add also the REST protocol (thus
removing the SOAP layer completely). If there is a demand for it, let
us know please.

</div>

Last but not least, Soaplab2 can be used also locally, without using
any transport protocol. If both clients and services sit on the same
machine, they can be run within a single JVM and connect each other
directly by loading Java classes. This tight connection also means
that there is no need to deploy such services. It is good for testing
your services before you deploy them and make them public. <p>

It makes also possible to use Soaplab2 features (like calling external
processes, or fetching and screen scraping remote web pages) within
another Java project - Soaplab2 is just another library used
there. <p>

We refer to this last protocol as the <em>local</em> protocol.

<a name="deploy"></a>
<h2>Deploying Soaplab2 services</h2>

The deployment of Web Services means to pack together all necessary
files and copy them to the Tomcat directory (assuming the Tomcat is
your servlet container of choice - but it can be any other servlet
container). <p>

<a name="tasks"></a>
<h3>Deployment Ant's tasks</h3>

Soaplab2 has Ant tasks to do that. The task names start with the
protocol you wish your services will be accessible by.

The only thing you need to do <em>before</em> calling deployment tasks
is to generate service metadata from the ACD files. I said <em>the
only thing</em> - which is true but it may be the hardest task you, as
a service provider, have. There is a <a
href="MetadataGuide.html">metadata guide</a> document about how to
create ACD files and what Ant tasks to call to create metadata in the
XML format from them. <p>

Summarizing, what has to be done before calling any deployment task:
<p>

<ul>

  <li> Create service metadata in XML format. The metadata are
supposed to be created in the <tt>metadata/generated</tt> directory
(that is the place where the deployment tasks will be looking for
them). <p>

  <li> A part of generated metadata is also one or more
<em>application list</em> files. They contain a list of your services
(with few other details). These files must be listed in the
<tt>soaplab.properties</tt> configuration file (as a property
<pn>applist</pn>). There may be other properties that you wish to set
differently from the default. Check the <a
href="ConfigurationGuide.html">configuration guide</a>. <p>

  <li> Check if your <tt>build.properties</tt> file has the property
<pn>tomcat.home</pn>, pointing to the location where your Tomcat is
installed. Otherwise deployment task cannot copy there any files. <p>

       The same file <tt>build.properties</tt> could also have the
property <pn>tomcat.host</pn> (with a host name under which your
Tomcat is visible to the outside world). <p>

</ul>

<h4>Ant tasks: jaxdeploy, axis1deploy</h4>

Usually, this is the only task you need to use. Internally, under the
hood, it calls the other tasks. <p>

The main question is <em>What services are being deployed?</em>. <p>

The answer is: all services whose names are listed in the application
list files included in the <pn>applist</pn> property (or properties)
in the <tt>soaplab.properties</tt> file. <p>

The <tt>soaplab.properties</tt> is created either from the
<tt>src/etc/config/soaplab.properties.template</tt> file or from your
own file defined by the <pn>my.soaplab.properties</pn> property. <p>

It sounds complicated and it may be so (even though I prefer to call
it rather flexible). But the good news is that it becomes complicated
and flexible only when you start to apply your own wishes. Using
defaults is simple:

<ul>

  <li class="tiny"> You create your ACD files in the
<tt>src/etc/acd/sowa</tt> or <tt>src/etc/acd/gowlab</tt> directories,
and generate XML by calling

<pre class="script">
ant gen
</pre>
  
  (as explained in the <a href="MetadataGuide.html">metadata
guide</a>). <p>

  <li class="tiny"> Then you call

<pre class="script">
ant jaxdeploy
</pre>
  
  (or <tt>ant axis1deploy</tt>, depending of the protocol of your
choice).

</ul><p>
And that's it. <p>

Let's continue now with the optional customisation. There are few
build-time properties that can influence what and how is deployed:

<dl>
  
  <dt> <span class="hitt">context.name</span>

  <dd> The deployment task takes your services and copy all necessary
files to the <tt>&lt;tomcat-home&gt;/webapps</tt> directory, under the
name either <b>soaplab2</b> (for the <em>jaxws</em> protocol) or
<b>soaplab2-axis</b> (for the <em>axis1</em> protocol). The name
(called a <em>context name</em>) is important because it will become
part of the URL of your services. By default, your services will be
accessible as:

<pre class="script">
http://url.of.your.tomcat/soaplab2/services
</pre>

or as:

<pre class="script">
http://url.of.your.tomcat/soaplab2-axis/services
</pre>

But you can customise it by using this property. The property value is
used as a new context name for the <em>jaxws</em> protocol, and with
appended suffix <tt>-axis</tt> for the <em>axis1</em> protocol. If you
do not like the suffix, you can specify the whole context name for the
<em>axis1</em> protocol by using another, more specific, property
<pn>axis1.context.name</pn>. <p>


  <dt> <span class="hitt">server.log4j.configuration</span>

  <dd> This property points to your own configuration file that will
be used by Soaplab services when deployed. This is a similar property
as the <pn>log4j.configuration</pn> that is used with the
<em>local</em> protocol. <p>


  <dt> <span class="hitt">server.log.dir</span>

  <dd> This property does not replace the whole logging configuration
file (as the previous one) but it changes only the location of the log
file. By default, there are two log files, <tt>soaplab2.log</tt> and
<tt>soaplab2-others.log</tt>, both created in the
<tt>&lt;tomcat-home&gt;/logs</tt> directory. This property can change
it. <p>


  <dt> <span class="hitt">server.metadata.dir</span>

  <dd> Soaplab2 services read their metadata in the run-time. By
default, all metadata are copied (as a part of deployment) to the
directory
<tt>&lt;tomcat-home&gt;/webapps/<em>soaplab2</em>/metadata</tt>. Which
is usually fine and it makes the Soaplab2 <em>war file</em>
self-contained. Everything sits nicely inside the Tomcat
container. <p>

       But there may be situations that you prefer to have easier
access to the metadata even after services have been deployed. Typical
case will be <a href="#undeploy">un-deploying</a> services
<em>on-the-fly</em> (dynamically, without restarting Tomcat). <p>

       Therefore, you can define that services should look for their
metadata elsewhere. And it is done by this property. Typically, you
point this property to the original place where the metadata have been
generated into. This is an example from my <tt>build.properties</tt>
file (the example includes also similar properties, described below):

<pre class="code">
# deployment - to use project root directory and not the "embedded"
# files in the Tomcat
server.metadata.dir = /home/senger/soaplab2/metadata/generated
server.runtime.dir  = /home/senger/soaplab2/_R_
server.scripts.dir  = /home/senger/soaplab2/run
</pre>

  <dt> <span class="hitt">server.runtime.dir</span>

  <dd> Soaplab2 services need some space in the file system to keep
inputs and results. By default, this space is located in the
<tt>&lt;tomcat-home&gt;/temp</tt> directory. <p>

       Again, the default place is good because everything is
self-contained within Tomcat space. This is especially useful when you
do not have easy or direct access to your Tomcat (for example, if you
are using the Tomcat manager to upload a Soaplab2 <em>war file</em>
there). <p>

       But sometimes you need to use a different place (for example
because of Tomcat's disk limitations). Use this property to point to a
different directory. <p>


  <dt> <span class="hitt">server.scripts.dir</span>

  <dd> Soaplab2 services run (usually) external programs. This was,
after all, the main original reason for making Soaplab. You have to
assure that they can find them. In order to do that, you can use the
run-time property <pn>addtopath.dir</pn> (see the <a
href="ConfigurationGuide.html#properties">configuration
guide</a>). <p>

       Or, you can put the program executable (usually a script) in
the directory specified by this property. By default, the deployment
task copies the whole contents of the <tt>run</tt> directory into
<tt>&lt;tomcat-home&gt;/webapps/<em>soaplab2</em>/WEB-INF/run</tt>
directory. The directory name is then put in the property
<pn>scripts.dir</pn>, which is (again by default) used in the
<pn>addtopath.dir</pn> (so the services will look there for the
external programs/scripts). <p>

  <dt> <span class="hitt">user.lib.dir</span>
  <dt> <span class="hitt">user.lib.include</span>

  <dd> These properties are important for developers adding new
plug-ins to the core Soaplab2. If they have a new code to be used by
Soaplab2, they have to tell, of course, the deployment task where the
code is. And this is the role of these properties. <p>

       The property <pn>user.lib.dir</pn> does not have any default
value. If it is defined, however, then it points to a directory where
all files matching the pattern given by the property
<pn>user.lib.include</pn> are copied from. The default value for the
property <pn>user.lib.include</pn> is <tt>*.jar</tt>. <p>

       The same properties, by the way, work also for the
<em>config</em> task when the run-time scripts are being created in
the <tt>build/run</tt> directory. <p>

</dl><p>

And there are couple of properties influencing the look &amp; feel of
the <a href="SpinetClient.html">Spinet web client</a>. Look at them in
a <a href="SpinetClient.html#deploy">separate section</a>. <p>


<h4>Ant tasks: jaxdist, axis1dist</h4>

These tasks copy all necessary files to the <tt>build/web</tt>
directory where they will be waiting for the <em>jaxwar</em> or
<em>axis1war</em> task to use them. <p>

It is a separate task because sometimes you can use so-called <em>hot
deployment</em> where the servlet container can be pointed to other
place to find its classes and other files. It is handy specially in
the development time. Useful for Eclipse Web Tool plug-in <img
src="images/eclipse.gif" border=0/>. <p>


<h4>Ant tasks: jaxwar, axis1war</h4>

These tasks pack together everything sitting in the <tt>build/web</tt>
directory into a <em>war file</em>. The <em>jaxdeploy</em> or
<em>axis1deploy</em> tasks then copy this war file into Tomcat (by
using the <em>jaxcopy</em> or <em>axis1copy</em> task). <p>

It is a separate task because sometimes you do not have an access to
the Tomcat when you are deploying your services. Perhaps Tomcat is
running on a different machine than you are building Soaplab2
services. Or, Tomcat is accessible only by the Tomcat manager that
accepts <em>war file</em> by uploading them. <p>

The name of the war file is created from the property
<pn>context.name</pn> as described above. It is placed in the
<tt>build/dist</tt> directory.<p>

<h4>Ant tasks: jaxdeployx, axis1deployx</h4>

These tasks prepare Soaplab web archive files, as in <em>jaxwar</em> and <em>axis1war</em> tasks,
and then deploy prepared <em>war files</em> to local/remote tomcat servers using Tomcat manager.

Details of Tomcat manager are defined using the following properties.

<dl>
  
  <dt> <span class="hitt">tomcat.manager.username</span>
  <dt> <span class="hitt">tomcat.manager.password</span>
  <dt> <span class="hitt">tomcat.manager.url</span>
</dl>
 
The web application path name is set to the name of the <em>war file</em> which is in turn determined by the property
<pn>context.name</pn> as described above.

<a name="webxml"></a>
<h3>How to configure your own <tt>web.xml</tt></h3>

Each web application (and Soaplab2, once deployed, is also a web
application) is controlled by a configuration file <tt>web.xml</tt>
(and for the <em>jaxws</em> protocol also by the file
<tt>sun-jaxws.xml</tt>). The deployment tasks, described above, create
these files from their templates (available in directories
<tt>src/etc/config/jaxws</tt> and <tt>src/etc/config/axis1</tt>) - and
you can influence this process by setting few built-time
properties. <p>


<dl>
  
  <dt> <span class="hitt">jaxws.web.xml.template</span>
  <dt> <span class="hitt">jaxws.xml.template</span>
  <dt> <span class="hitt">axis1.web.xml.template</span>

  <dd> First of all, you can have your own whole templates. These
properties define their locations. Caveat lecture! <p>

       The properties names reflect different protocols. <p>

  <dt> <span class="hitt">web.display.name</span>

  <dd> This property specifies the Web Application display name, a
short name that can be displayed by GUI tools for servlet container
(such as the Tomcat Manager). Default value is: <em>Soaplab Web
Services</em>. <p>
       

  <dt> <span class="hitt">web.display.desc</span>

  <dd> This property provides a descriptive text about the Web
Application (again, used by GUI tools, such as Tomcat Manager). The
default value is: <em>The project home page is
http://soaplab.sourceforge.net/soaplab2/</em>. <p>

       
  <dt> <span class="hitt">url.pattern.for.list</span>
  <dt> <span class="hitt">url.pattern.for.others</span>

  <dd> These two properties are only for <em>jaxws</em> protocol. They
define patterns that - when found in the requesting URL - redirect
request to the Soaplab2 services. The property
<pn>url.pattern.for.list</pn> is a URL pattern for the Soaplab2
service providing list of all individual Soaplab2 services, and the
<pn>url.pattern.for.others</pn> defines a pattern for individual
services. <p>

       In other words, these properties define the URLs to access
Soaplab2 services (they are not the only ones, other parts of the URLs
are defined by the <pn>context.name</pn> and your Tomcat host name and
port number). <p>

       It is probably easier to show where these properties are
used. This is a part of the <tt>web.xml</tt> template file (the tokens
in upper-cases will be replaced by values of your properties:

<pre class="code">
&lt;!-- Soaplab2 List service --&gt;
&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;soaplab2&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;url-pattern&gt;@URL_FOR_LIST@&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;

&lt;!-- Soaplab2 all other services --&gt;
&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;soaplab2&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;url-pattern&gt;@URL_FOR_OTHERS@&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
</pre>

       The default values are <tt>/services/list</tt> for the list
service and <tt>/services/*</tt> for the individual services. <p>

</dl> <p>




<a name="undeploy"></a>
<h2>Un-deploying Soaplab2 services</h2>

Quick answer is: Just comment out (in the application list files) the
service names you do not wish to be runnable anymore. <p>

Such services will still finish their currently running jobs, and may
even return their results (it depends on how long they were running
and how are the <a href="ConfigurationGuide.html#properties">run-time
properties</a> <pn>jobs.cleaning.interval</pn> and
<pn>services.cleaning.interval</pn> set), but they will not be able to
start new jobs. <p>
