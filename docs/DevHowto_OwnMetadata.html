<h2>How to provide Soaplab2 metadata in your own way</h2>

<img src="images/software_developer.jpg" border=0 align="left"/>

<div>

Soaplab2 uses two kinds of metadata: one describing list of available
(provided) services, and one describing individual services. By
default, they are both expressed as XML files: the analysis list
according to the <a href="SoaplabList.dtd">SoaplabList.dtd</a>, the
service metadata complying with the <a
href="SoaplabAnalysis.dtd">SoaplabAnalysis.dtd</a>. <p>

If you want to have your own format, or storage, of any of these
kinds, you can. For example, you can store the XML metadata files in
the database instead of having them in the local file system. Or, you
can have your own format, perhaps a non-XML one, for all or just some
of your Soaplab services. <p>

In order to accomplish it, you need to write some implementation
classes. This <em>How-To</em> document explains what is needed and
where to put it.

<div class="note">

Actually, the main reason of this How-To document is to create a
description what classes are being used and how they are connected in
order to make the future Soaplab2 maintenance easier. But one never
knows...
