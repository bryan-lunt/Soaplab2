<h1>Providing strongly typed services</h1>

<p>One of the unique features of Soaplab is its generic interface that
makes it possible to use one single interface when accessing any
Soaplab Web Services regardless of the command line interface of
underlying programs. However, it is not possible to specify
input/output data types as part of Soaplab generic WSDL; instead the
interface accommodates methods to query this information. This
difference from common WSDL interfaces, for example, doesn't allow
standard Web Services clients to check/validate input data before
sending a request or output data after a response has been
received. There was a growing concern in Bioinformatics Web Services
community that Soaplab should include input/output type descriptions
at WSDL level. To address this concern, starting with version 2.2,
Soaplab includes an interface called <em>typed interface</em>
(sometimes <em>typed services</em> that includes input output type
definitions at WSDL level. This document describes how to create and
deploy such services.</p>

<h3>Relation between regular and strongly typed services</h3>

<p>The typed services are just <em>additions</em> to existing,
non-typed (regular) Soaplab services. Once you make them available,
they will co-exist with the regular services on the same server. You
cannot have <em>only</em> typed services (unless you manually edit
some configuration files in WEB-INF directory - but it is not covered
by this document).</p>

<p>In order to access typed services you use a slightly different URL,
using the <b>/typed/services</b> instead of just
<em>/services</em>. For example, an endpoint of the strongly typed
<tt>classic.helloworld</tt> service is (using the default host, port
and context names) is:

<pre class="script">
  http://localhost:8080/soaplab2/<b>typed</b>/services/classic.helloworld
</pre>

For the same service, you can also use an alias:

<pre class="script">
  http://localhost:8080/soaplab2/<b>typed</b>/services/classic.helloworld.sa
</pre>

indicating that the WSDL for this service is semantically annotated
(see more about WSDLs in the document <a
href="TypedServicesClients.html#wsdl">Using strongly typed
services</a>).</p>

<p>The regular services can be deployed using either <em>jaxws</em> or
<em>axis1</em> protocol (see more in the <a
href="Deployment.html">deployment
guide</a>). By contrast, the typed services use always only
<em>jaxws</em> protocol. But they can still co-exist with regular
services deployed by the <em>axis1</em>. </p>

<p>There is no strongly typed equivalent of the <em>list</em> service
(that would provide a list of available typed services) but there is a
web page (default name:
<tt>http://localhost:8080/soaplab2/services/list</tt>) that lists all
WSDLs (well, this is true when deploying regular services using
<tt>jaxws</tt> protocol).</p>

<h3>How to create typed interface</h3>

<p>The services with strongly typed interfaces are relatively easy to
create - by providing just one additional property in the build
time. Everything else is done automagically.</p>

<p>The typed services are created from data (rather metadata)
available from the regular services. Therefore, you need first to have
regular services (as described elsewhere in the Soaplab
documentation). The regular services can be either first deployed, or
you can deploy both, regular and typed, services, in the same
time.</p>

<p>The typed services are created by generating WSDL files and some
Java code in the <em>generated</em> directory. This happens when the
property <span class="hitt">typedinterface.enable</span> is set to
true. For example, you can create a <em>war</em> file with both
regular and typed services by:

<pre class="script">
ant -Dtypedinterface.enable=true jaxwar
</pre>

The above line creates a <em>war</em> file with both types of services
- but in order to do it it uses existing regular services. And to
access them, it uses protocol defined in <a
href="BuildClientGuide.html"><em>soaplab.client.properties</em></a>
file (because it gets services metadata like any other regular Soaplab
client). Therefore, if you have not yet deployed your regular services
you need to use the <em>local</em> protocol (a protocol that uses
directly Soaplab classes without any Web Service ornamentation). In
such case, edit your <em>soaplab.client.properties</em> first:

<pre class="code">
# ------------------------------
# how to access service/services
# ------------------------------
protocol = local
</pre>

or use a slightly cumbersome Ant invocation:

<pre class="script">
ant -Dtypedinterface.enable=true '-Dargs=-protocol local' jaxwar
</pre>

The resulting <tt>war</tt> file can be deployed to your Soaplab
server as usual (by using the Tomcat manager or by using Ant's task
<tt>jaxdeploy</tt> instead of <tt>jaxwar</tt>). Only expect slightly
longer start-up time of the Soaplab web application after
deployment. </p>
