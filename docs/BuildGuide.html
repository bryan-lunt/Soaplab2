<h1>Soaplab2: How to build it</h1>
<p>

<img class="motto-img" src="images/motto-installation-and-building.jpg" border=0 align="left"/>

Soaplab is installed and built by <em>Ant</em>. <p>

<em>Ant</em> is a very powerful tool that can do almost everything. It
can be also widely configured, by setting various properties, in order
to customise user's actions. Which means that its usage can sometimes
become a bit confusing. Therefore, this documents starts by explaining
few basic rules how to use Ant, and only the next chapter describes
how to use it for building Soaplab2. <p>

<h3>General rules for using Ant</h3>

The Ant has a help for the command-line details (<tt>ant
-help</tt>). The list of available tasks can be obtained by:

<pre class="script">
ant -projecthelp
</pre>

It displays something like this:
<pre class="code">

</pre>

Soaplab2 uses Ant version 1.6.5 and later. Check your version. For
example:

<pre class="script">
ant -version
Apache Ant version 1.7.0 compiled on December 13 2006
</pre>

The Ant can be (and, in some point, should be) customised by defining
some properties in the file <pn><tt>build.properties</tt></pn>
(located in the Soaplab2 directory). Such file does not come
automatically with the Soaplab distribution (because its contents is
specific for your installation and environment). However, there is a
template of such file <tt>build.properties.template</tt>. Make a copy
of this template, and un-comment and edit properties that you
wish/need to change. <p>

<div class="note">

If you wish to use the same properties for more projects, you can also
put the <tt>build.properties</tt> file into your home directory. Such
property file is then shared and re-used by every project. The
question is, however, whether it is a good practise. You can easily
forget about it and have a hard time to find why something is not
working as expected.

</div>

What is the format of the <tt>build.properties</tt> file?  Simply
speaking, it follows the same syntax as required by
<tt>java.util.Property.load()</tt> method. The gory details can be
found <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html#load(java.io.InputStream)">here</a>.
For example, here are few, randomly picked-up, properties: <p>

<pre class="sscript">
compile.deprecation = true
compile.warnings = true
tomcat.home = /home/senger/Software/jakarta-catalina
emboss.home = /home/senger/Software/emboss
</pre>

The usual problem with properties could be to mix together properties
used by Ant and properties used by Soaplab2. The properties used by
Ant are usually referred to as <em>build-time properties</em>, while
the Soaplab2 properties, used in the run-time by Soaplab2 services,
are called <em>run-time properties</em>.

<div class="note">

About Soaplab2 run-time properties, you will learn all details later,
in the <a href="ConfigurationGuide.html">configuration guide</a>. They
use a similar syntax (similar, not the same, because the run-time
properties allow more features than the build-time properties) but
they are used in different time - when Soaplab2 services are running
and accessed by users. <p>

What adds to the confusion is also a fact that Ant helps to build
run-time property files for Soaplab2 by re-using (propagating) some
build-time properties to the run-time properties. Sorry about it...

</div>

The Ant properties can be also specified directly on the command line
by using <tt>-D</tt> option (or more of them, if you wish to specify
more properties). The properties on the command line has precedence
over properties defined in the property files. For example:

<pre class="script">
ant -Dcompile.warnings=true compile
ant -Dcompile.warnings=true -Dcompile.debug=false compile
</pre>

The whole construct with the <tt>-D</tt> option must constitute a
single command-line parameter. Therefore, this is wrong:

<img src="images/wrong.gif" border=0 align="left"/>
<pre class="sscript">
ant -D compile.warnings=true compile
</pre>
<br clear="all"/>

From the same reason, if the property value contains a space, the
whole construct must be quoted:

<pre class="sscript">
ant "-Dbig.apple=New York" 
</pre>

<h4>Some build-time properties</h4>

Of course, the most important is to know what properties can be
used. Fortunately, they are not many of them because most of them have
reasonable default values. The ones you <em>have to specified</em> are
those defining something specific to your machine. At the moment, it
is only one such property - defining the local path to your Tomcat:

<pre class="script">
tomcat.home = /home/senger/Software/jakarta-catalina
</pre>

Other properties that you <em>may use</em> are described later in this
document, when individual Ant's targets (tasks) are explained. The
best way (but not always an easy) way to find what properties can be
used, is to look into <tt>build.xml</tt> file (and its include files
in the <tt>xmls</tt> directory). <p>

For enabling typed interface for your Soaplab Web Services please

<h4><img src="images/eclipse.gif" border=0/> A note for Eclipse users</h4>

<img class="motto-img" src="images/eclipse-ant.png" border=0 align="left"/>

<div>
If you are a Java developer, you may be using <a
href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>. Be aware, that some tasks
defined in the Soaplab2's Ant cannot be done (or not easily done)
directly by Eclipse itself. You still should make them by calling
the Ant. But you can do it from Eclipse (see there is a difference:
<em>by Eclipse</em> and <em>from Eclipse</em>). Use a double click in
the Ant's view. <p>

This is especially true for the <pn>config</pn> task that creates
important files in the <tt>build/classes</tt> directory, the files
needed for proper run of Soaplab. But Eclipse has a tendency
(especially after refreshing by F5 key) to remove these files. The
<tt>config</tt> task brings them back. (When using Ant from the
command-line you usually do not call this task directly, it is called
by other tasks.)

</div>
<br clear="all"/>

<h4>Ant and Maven</h4>

Soaplab2 is built by Ant but under the hood it uses nice features of
another famous tool - <a
href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>. Mainly because it nicely
handles Soaplab2's dependencies on the third-party libraries. You do
not need to know details about it - but you should know what is going
on on your computer. Here it is: <p>

Ant calls Maven whenever you build Soaplab2 to find whether there are
some unresolved third-party dependencies. If there are - and
definitely there are the first time you build Soaplab2 - Maven
downloads them to your computer. It creates a <em>local Maven
repository</em> - which is a directory in your home directory (the
name depends on the platform: on Linux, its name is
<tt>.m2</tt>). This repository can be used by more projects using
Maven. Important is to know that:

<ul>
  
  <li class="tiny"> Something is created <em>outside</em> of your
Soaplab2 directory, and <p>

  <li class="tiny"> The first time, it can take some time, and you need
to be on-line.

</ul><p>

There is an <a
href="http://pantheon.generationcp.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=379&Itemid=197">article</a>
describing details how the Ant-Maven marriage is handled. It is from
another project, but the principles (and files) are very similar to
Soaplab2 (because both Soaplab2 and the article share the same author
<img src="images/smile.gif" border=0/>). The article also explains
what to do if you wish to have the local Maven repository created
elsewhere - which you may need if your home directory has some space
limits. <p>



<a name="install"></a>
<h3>Installing Soaplab2</h3>

Once you have Soaplab2 in your directory, by default named
<tt>soaplab2</tt>, you can install it by calling:

<pre class="script">
ant install
</pre>

The <em>installation</em> is nothing more than calling several Ant's
task in a row. <p>

<div class="note"> There is also a simplified version of this
installation task, the <tt>install-clients</tt> task. You can use it
when you wish to <a href="BuildClientGuide.html">install only Soaplab2
clients</a>.</div>

First, it downloads one special library that glues Maven with
Ant. Without this library, the Ant would complain that it cannot
work. Internally (and anytime repeatable), it calls <tt>ant
bootstrap</tt>. <p>

Next, it checks that you have installed Perl. This is a legacy issue
and will, sooner or later, disappear. The goal is to have Soaplab2
pure Java. The only remaining non-Java part is the converter between
ACD and XML files (more about ACD files in the <a
href="MetadataGuide.html">metadata guide</a>). <p>

After that, it reminds you to create the <tt>build.properties</tt>
file and put there properties locating the place where you have
installed Tomcat. These properties are not used yet, but ultimately
they will be needed when you deploy your Soaplab2 services (see more
about that step in the <a href="Deployment.html">deployment guide</a>
document). <p>

Then the real installation starts. In a series of steps, Ant downloads
many third-party libraries, builds the whole Soaplab2, generates XML
files for several testing services, and as a jewel at the end, it runs
one testing service, the <em>HelloWorld</em> service. <p>

<div class="note">

The HelloWorld service call may fail if your machine has Perl program
installed elsewhere than in <tt>/usr/bin/perl</tt>. It will almost
definitely fail on Windows. If you still wish to see this service
succeeded please correct the testing scripts in he <tt>run</tt>
directory.

</div>

Once installation finished, it suggests to run the deployment task:

<pre class="script">
ant jaxdeploy
</pre>

This will deploy few testing services into your Tomcat and you can
start using them (see the <a href="CmdLineClient.html">command-line
client</a> document how to use your services from the command-line):

<pre class="script">
build/run/run-cmdline-client -name classic.helloworld -w -r
</pre>

Or, perhaps even easier, you can open your browser and point it to
your Tomcat and use the <a href="SpinetClient.html">Spinet
client</a>. Unless you run Tomcat on a different port, or unless you
deployed your services into a different <em>context</em>, the URL to
open should be this: <a href="http://localhost:8080/soaplab2/"
target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/soaplab2/</a>. <p>


The installation task can be repeated anytime without any harm. <p>


<a name="build"></a>
<h3>Soaplab2 building tasks</h3>

This chapter lists various Ant tasks, explaining what they do and how
you can customise them. For better understanding, it helps if you read
first the <a href="#ant">general rules for using Ant</a>. <p>

More Ant tasks (the more specialised ones) are described in separate
documents. The deployment tasks:

<pre class="code">
 axis1deploy  Deploy (copy) an Axis-1 war file to a Tomcat server
 axis1dist    Populate Axis-1 services distribution space
 axis1war     Create a Axis-1 war file for services distribution
 jaxdeploy    Deploy (copy) a JAX-WS war file to a Tomcat server
 jaxdist      Populate JAX-WS services distribution space
 jaxwar       Create a JAX-WS war file for services distribution
</pre>

are in the <a href="Deployment.html">deployment guide</a>, and the
metadata tasks:

<pre class="code">
 cleanxml     Remove all generated service metadata
 gen          Generate service metadata from all ACD files
 genebi       Generate XML metadata for EBI's sample services.
 genemboss    Generate XML metadata for EMBOSS (needs EMBOSS installed).
 gengowlab    Generate XML metadata for Gowlab services.
 gensowa      Generate XML metadata for Sowa services.
</pre>

are in the <a href="MetadataGuide.html#build">service metadata
guide</a>. <p>

The remaining tasks are:

<h4>Ant task: all</h4>

This is simply an aggregation of several other tasks. It cleans the
building space and fills it again with a fresh build. <p>

Most of the new created files (those that can be re-generated anytime
later) are generated in the <tt>build</tt> directory.

<h4>Ant task: bootstrap</h4>

An important task - but done only once, at the very beginning.  It
fetches a Maven library. <p>

Note that other libraries can be (and are) fetched later by Maven, but
Maven itself needs a library which obviously "cannot be fetched before
it is fetched". That's why we have here a separate task for
it. Probably we should call it better a Catch-22 task <img
src="images/smile.gif" border=0/>.

<h4>Ant task: clean</h4>

It removes all generated files, and the <tt>build</tt> directory
itself. Whenever you encountered a strange problem, the first try is
to clean and build again:

<pre class="script">
ant clean compile
</pre>


<h4>Ant task: compile</h4>

It compiles all source code. It is also a default task - the one
called when you simply call <tt>ant</tt>. <p>

You can influence how the Java compiled code is produced by setting
compilation properties. The default values are:

<pre class="code">
compile.debug = true
compile.verbose = false
compile.deprecation = false
compile.optimize = false
compile.warnings = false
</pre>


<h4>Ant task: config</h4>

It creates all run-time scripts and configuration files. This is
usually not called directly (the other tasks call it) but it is an
important task. <p>

Generally, it transforms template files (sitting mostly in the
directory <tt>src/etc/config</tt>) into real configuration files and
puts them into <tt>build/classes</tt> directory where they are used by
Soaplab services. <p>

The template files do not contain any local dependencies (such as a
full path to your <tt>soaplab2</tt> directory). The <em>config</em>
task injects the "local knowledge" into them during the copying. The
"injection" is done on places marked in the templates by pairs of the
&#64; characters. You do not need to know it - unless you wish to
write your own template file. Please check the template what injection
points are used. Here is an example of two pairs of replacement tokens
(from the <tt>soaplab.properties.template</tt>:

<pre class="code">
base.dir = @PROJECT_HOME@
metadata.dir = @METADATA_DIR@
...
</pre>

If you have your own template file, you need to let Ant know about it
by setting a build-time property pointing to your template file. For
example, for the major Soaplab2 configuration file, you set the
property <tt>my.soaplab.properties</tt>:

<pre class="code">
my.soaplab.properties = testing.soaplab.properties
</pre>

Other build-time properties for setting other configuration files are:

<pre class="code">
log4j.configuration = testing.log4j.properties
my.soaplab.client.properties = testing.soaplab.client.properties
</pre>

Examples and details about configuration files are in the <a
href="ConfigurationGuide.html">configuration guide</a>. <p>

The <em>config</em> task also generates <em>run-time scripts</em> into
<tt>build/run</tt> directory. The scripts can be used to start various
Soaplab2 client and administrative command-line programs (as shown in
the <a href="CmdLineClient.html">command-line client</a> and <a
href="AdminTools">administrative tools</a> documents). <p>

The <em>run-time scripts</em> are also a good place where you can see
names and location of all third-party libraries Soaplab2 is using. <p>


<h4>Ant task: docs</h4>

It generates documentation, mostly the javadoc API. <p>

The Soaplab2 is distributed together with the full documentation. In
includes also hyper-links to the API documentation - which must be
first created by this task. Whenever you see a dead link in the
Soaplab pages, a chance is that it may be revived by running this
task.

<h4>Ant task: info-list</h4>

This is an interesting task: it actually runs some Soaplab2 code (the
same the Soaplab2 services run), reading your configuration files, and
showing the current list of Soaplab2 services on your machine. The
services may be not yet available to all clients (they may not be yet
deployed; even the Tomcat does not need to be yet started). For
example:<p>

<pre class="smaller-code">
  [service] alignment.wu_blastn_raw
  [service] alignment.wu_blastn_xml
  [service] alignment.wu_blastp_raw
  [service] alignment.wu_blastp_xml
  [service] alignment.wu_blastx_raw
  [service] alignment.wu_blastx_xml
  [service] alignment.wu_tblastn_raw
  [service] alignment.wu_tblastn_xml
  [service] alignment.wu_tblastx_raw
  [service] alignment.wu_tblastx_xml
  [service] alignment_consensus.cons
  [service] alignment_consensus.megamerger
  [service] alignment_consensus.merger
  [service] alignment_differences.diffseq
  [service] alignment_dot_plots.dotmatcher
  [service] alignment_dot_plots.dotpath
  [service] alignment_dot_plots.dottup
  [service] alignment_dot_plots.polydot
  [service] alignment_global.est2genome
  ...
</pre>

It also creates a file <tt>services.list</tt>. Its name can be changed
by the property <pn>services.names.file</pn>:

<pre class="script">
ant -Dservices.names.file=my.services info-list
</pre>

The file contains nothing more than the service names, each one on a
separate line. <p>


<h4>Ant task: jars</h4>

It creates all jar files related to this project. Well, what else to
say...

<h4>Ant task: test-junit</h4>

It runs the junit test cases. <p>

Before running them, it compiles them first (the testing classes are
not part of the normal compilation). Running this task may give you
the following error:

<pre class="smallercode">
================================= WARNING ================================
Junit library is not present in a correct directory. Tests not executed.
The library (junit.jar) is, however, in your local Maven repository.
Therefore:
    Put it in your ${ANT_HOME}/lib directory.
    Or, put in your ${HOME}/.ant/lib directory.
    Or start ant with -lib &lt;your junit library&gt;.
==========================================================================
</pre>

<a name="eclipse"></a>
<h4><img src="images/eclipse.gif" border=0/> Ant task: initeclipse and Notes for Eclipse users</h4>


Many of the building tasks can be accomplished also from Eclipse. But
not all. For example, as already mentioned above, the Ant's
<em>config</em> task must be run by Ant. Another example is the
<em>docs</em> task (generating javadoc API documentation). There are,
however, few issues that, when not known and solved properly, can be
annoying:

<ul>

  <li> Eclipse automatically creates and uses two configuration
files (both are created in the main <tt>soaplab2</tt> directory): the
<tt>.project</tt> and <tt>.classpath</tt>. For building purposes, the
latter one is more important. It contains information about what to
compile (source paths) and where to put it (output paths). You should
make sure that both Eclipse and Ant use the same locations. The best
way to do so is to use the provided <tt>.classpath.template</tt> file
and to make its copy (named <tt>.classpath</tt>) and only then start
Eclipse. <p>

  <li> Whenever (well, not always; I am not sure exactly when it
happens) you refresh Eclipse Soaplab2 project, it removes Soaplab2's
configuration files from the <tt>build/classes</tt>. You need to run
the Ant's <em>config</em> task to re-create them.

       <div class="note">

       If anybody can tell me how to do it better I will appreciate it
very much. Thanks.

       </div>

  <li> Maven and Eclipse is another issue. All Soaplab2 dependencies
are defined in the <tt>xmls/project.pom</tt>. You obviously want to
share this dependencies in Eclipse, as well. <p>

       First, you need to install a Maven plug-in into your
Eclipse. Then, you need to create several <tt>pom.xml</tt> files - the
files where the Eclipse Maven plug-in looks for the
dependencies. These files are created by running the Ant's
<em>initeclipse</em> task (which is often invoked from other tasks
automatically, but can be run also separately). Make sure that you
enable Maven plug-in only <em>after</em> the <tt>pom.xml</tt> files
have been created. <p>

       This is the sequence of steps I usually follow when Eclipse is
not happy (which happens when Soaplab2's dependencies or Soaplab2's
version change):

       <ol>

	 <li class="dcount"> Disable Maven in Eclipse.
	 
	 <li class="dcount"> Manually remove <tt>pom.xml</tt> and
<tt>src/main/pom.xml</tt> files.

	 <div class="note">

	 This should be done automatically by Ant but I have not yet
figured why it does not do it always.

	 </div>
	 
	 <li class="dcount"> Run <tt>ant config</tt>.

	 <li class="dcount"> Enable again Maven in Eclipse. <p>

       </ol>

       There is also an <a
href="http://pantheon.generationcp.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=379&Itemid=197#eclipse">article</a>
about the above. It is, again, an article from another project, but
similar to Soaplab2, regarding the usage of Ant and maven.

       <div class="note">

       Until the article is updated, it explains situation with
the Maven plug-in version 1. With the version 2 or later (available
now) it may be easier.

       </div>
