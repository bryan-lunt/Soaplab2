We believe that the released version of Soaplab2 is functional. But we
also know about many yet-to-be-implemented issues. <p>

They are casually listed mixed together with the plans and suggestions
in the <a href="copies/NOTES">NOTES</a> file. One day, they either
disappear (because they all will be solved), or I will format them
more properly <img src="images/smile.gif" border=0/>. <p>

There is also a casual document listing issues that we are not sure if
they should be solved or forgotten - see the <a
href="copies/DISCUSSION">DISCUSSION</a>. <p>

Last but not least, there is a casual list of <a
href="copies/SPINET.NOTES">issues and plans with Spinet</a> Web
client. <p>


We will also try to keep track about the discovered bugs in the <a
target="_top"
href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=104834">SourceForge Bug
Report</a> system. Please send your bugs preferably there. <p>


However, it is good to have the major issues listed here:

<a name="issues"></a>
<h4> Major known issues </h4>

<ul>

  <li> More complex <a href="Gowlab.html">Gowlab</a> services (those
requiring additional XSLT transformation of results) are not yet
supported. Also the Gowlab documentation is not written yet. <p>

  <li> The Soaplab2 notification protocols are not fully implemented
(the <em>client-poll</em> works fully, but not the
<em>server-push</em>). <p>

  <li> Storing results in a relational database. <p>

</ul><p>

<a name="plans"></a>
<h4> Major plans for future </h4>

<ul>

  <li> Fully Java-pure converter/parser of the metadata ACD files to
XML files. <p>

  <li> A GUI (a working name is <em>Soaplab Dashboard</em>) for
helping Soaplab service providers to create metadata files, deploy and
monitor their services. <p>

</ul><p>
