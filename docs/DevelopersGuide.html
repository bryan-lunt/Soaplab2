Daily bread of every developer is an API. Soaplab2 API, including
those classes and interfaces that are supposed to be extended,
enhanced or re-implemented, are generated <a
href="API/index.html">here</a>.

<div class="note">

Here, and on several other places, this document refers to the Soaplab2
API. If you are browsing your local copy of the Soaplab2
documentation, and the API links are broken, you need to generate the
API first by calling an Ant task <tt>docs</tt>:

<pre class="script">
ant docs
</pre>

</div>

But browsing the Soaplab2 source code is usually inevitable (e.g. the
generated API does not include <tt>protected</tt> methods that could
be quite helpful when sub-classing). <p>

Many features in Soaplab2 are configurable by Java properties. When
developing, you should be aware of the singleton class <a
href="API/org/soaplab/services/Config.html">Config</a> that provides
access to all Soaplab2 properties and also defines their
names. Because Soaplab2 configuration is equally important for
Soaplab2 service providers, the <a
href="ConfigurationGuide.html">Configuration Guide</a> with all
details is included in their documentation section. <p>

The Soaplab2 design is driven by the idea of being flexible and
extensible. Therefore, the core of the Soaplab2 architecture are
the plug-in mechanisms: <p>


<a name="plugin"></a>
<h2>Plug-in mechanisms</h2>

A plug-in mechanism (in contrast to a regular sub-classing) adds
specific behaviour to the system without a need to change and
recompile the existing classes. The Soaplab2 uses two such mechanisms:

<dl class="indent">
<dt> <a href="#spi-plugin">SPI-based plug-ins</a>
<dt> <a href="#class-plugin">Naming a class in services metadata</a>
</dl><p>


<a name="spi-plugin"></a>
<h3>SPI (<em>Service Provider Interface</em>) plug-ins</h3>

Java (starting from version 1.3) defines rules how to store and find
various implementations of the same interface. It is part of the <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jar/jar.html">Jar File
Specification</a>, chapter <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jar/jar.html#Service%20Provider">Service
Provider</a>. A usual, almost reference, implementation of this Java
part, also used by Soaplab2, is the <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/discovery/">Apache Commons
Service Discovery</a> library. <p>

The Soaplab2 uses this mechanism to add behaviour shared by <b>all</b>
Soaplab2 services (in contrast to the second mechanism, see below,
that allows to add specific behaviour per service base). Here is a
list of the available SPI plug-in hooks (described <a
href="#spi_plugins">below</a> in details):

<ul>
  <li> <span class="highlight">AnalysisInventory</span> allows to add new lists of available services
  <li> <span class="highlight">EventDeserializer</span> allows to deal with user-defined Soaplab events
  <li> <span class="highlight">EventListener</span> allows to add Soaplab2 events listeners
  <li> <span class="highlight">MetadataAccessorFactory</span> allows to use user-specific metadata formats
  <li> <span class="highlight">PersistentStorage</span> allows to add various kinds of result storages
</ul> <p>

The usage of the SPI plug-ins is straightforward:

<ol>
  <li class="dcount"> The directory
<tt>src/etc/config/services/META-INF/services</tt> contains a file for
each plug-in, named by the same name as an interface that the plug-in
implements. For example, file
<tt>org.soaplab.services.storage.PersistentStorage</tt> is for the
plug-in dealing with storing results. <p>

       Write your own implementation of a selected interface and put
the name of such class into this file (each class name on a separate
line). For example, the persistent storage file may have this content:

       <pre class="script">
org.soaplab.services.storage.FileStorage
org.soaplab.services.storage.DBStorage
       </pre>

       Which means that there are two mechanisms how and where to
store Soaplab2 results: one is a local file system (implemented by the
class <tt>org.soaplab.services.storage.FileStorage</tt>) and the
second one stores results in a database (implemented by the class
<tt>org.soaplab.services.storage.DBStorage</tt>). <p>

       
  <li class="dcount"> Run the Soaplab2's Ant task <em>config</em> (or the default
<em>compile</em> - which includes the <em>config</em>, as well):

       <pre class="script">
ant config
       </pre>

       It creates a jar file <tt>services-config.jar</tt> in the
<tt>build/lib</tt> directory. When this jar file - and, of course,
your own implementation class - are found on the CLASSPATH, your
plug-in starts to work. <p>

       There are few properties that can be set to influence this Ant
task (but usually there is no need to change them):

       <dl>
	 <dt> <pn>services.config.dir</pn> <dd>contains a directory name
with plug-in files (default value is
<tt>&lt;soaplab-home&gt;/src/etc/config/services/META-INF/services</tt>)

	 <dt> <pn>services.config.jar</pn> <dd>names the resulting jar
file (default value is <tt>services-config.jar</tt>)

	 <dt> <pn>released.date</pn> <dd>contains a date that
is put in the created jar file as a MANIFEST property
<em>Released-Date</em> (default value is the today's date).
       </dl>
       <p>

</ol>
<p>

<a name="class-plugin"></a>
<h3>Naming a class in services metadata</h3>

Another plug-in mechanism is designed for individual services. Each
service has its own metadata and they can contain class names (or, in
some cases, a convenient synonyms of class names). In some point, the
Soaplab2 makes instances of these classes and they serve particular
purposes for this particular service. <p>

There are the following uses for this kind of plug-in mechanism
(again, the details <a href="#class_plugins">below</a>):

<ul>
  <li> A very important one, actually the most crucial one, is a class
representing a <span class="highlight">Job</span>. <p>

       A Job represents a single service invocation (such as running
an analysis tool, or fetching a web page). The whole Soaplab2
infrastructure (including accessing service metadata, storing and
retrieving results to and from various persistent storages, and
sending events about jobs) is the same for all Soaplab2 services - but
Jobs are specific. Some of them can start local tools (aka AppLab in
previous Soaplab), some of them can fetch web pages (Gowlab), and some
of them can, for example, just start a local Java class to do some
computation. <p>

       Therefore, anytime you consider an extension to Soaplab2, you
should think in terms of a new implementation of a Job interface. <p>


       Each service needs to know what class should be instantiated
when a request to create a job comes. Some Job classes can represent
the whole family of services (for example, all services invoking a
command-line analysis tool use the same Job class for it - in this
case it is the <tt>org.soaplab.services.cmdline.CmdLineJob</tt>), some
Job classes are specific for one or only few services (for example,
there could be a specific Job exploring Google search API). Depending
on the Job scope, the Job class name can be specified directly in the
service metadata, or in metadata containing list of available
services. Details in <a href="MetadataGuide.html">metadata
guide</a>. <p>

       The Job interface (that all Job classes must implement) is
defined in <a
href="API/org/soaplab/services/Job.html"><tt>org.soaplab.services.Job</tt></a>. The
best way how to implement a new Job type is to inherit from the
<tt>org.soaplab.services.AbstractJob</tt> class. <p>

       More about it <a href="#class_job">below</a>. <p>


  <li> Each <span class="highlight">input</span> provided to an
analysis tool (or to other sources, like web pages), and each <span
class="highlight">result</span> obtained from an analysis tool (or
from other sources), can be adapted by a plug-in defined by the
interface <a
href="API/org/soaplab/services/adaptor/DataAdaptor.html"><tt>org.soaplab.services.adaptor.DataAdaptor</tt></a>.
       This is an optional interface (most of the inputs and results
will <em>not</em> be adapted). <p>

       More about it <a href="#class_data">below</a>. <p>


  <li> Rarely used, but helpful in special cases, is an interface that
defines a new kind of a <span class="highlight">command-line
argument</span>. An argument whose syntax and use is so special that
cannot be expressed in the existing set of Soaplab2 parameter classes
in package <tt>org.soaplab.services.cmdline</tt>. The interface is
defined in <a
href="API/org/soaplab/services/cmdline/Parameter.html"><tt>org.soaplab.services.cmdline.Parameter</tt></a>. <p>

       More about it <a href="#class_parameter">below</a>. <p>

</ul> <p>

So far, we described how to name a class in service metadata. But
there is also one other place where to name a class: a place that is
dictated by the used protocol. <p>

All web applications (and the Web Services are just kinds of web
applications) are "servlets" and they require to specify what class
should be instantiated when a request for a particular web application
comes to a servlet container (such as the Apache Tomcat server).
Different Java toolkits for Web Services require to specify it in
different places. For example, the <em>JAX-WS</em> toolkit uses
configuration files <tt>web.xml</tt> and <tt>sun-jaxws.xml</tt>. Or,
the old <em>Axis 1</em> needs it in <tt>server-config.wsdd</tt>
file. <p>

In Soaplab2, creating or changing these files is part of the service
deployment, and therefore, it is described in the documentation for
service providers. Few details are also mentioned below, in the
section <a href="#new-protocol">What to do in order to add a new
protocol</a>. <p>


<a name="architecture"></a>
<h2>Architecture</h2>

<a href="images/architecture.png"><img src="images/architecture-small.png" border=0 align="left"/></a>

The architecture image shows the major parts of the Soaplab2
infrastructure, and the colours indicate where and how it can be
extended. <p>

The <span class="yellow">yellow</span> boxes are places where the SPI
mechanism looks for plug-ins. (There is one more SPI place that is not
shown here - because of clarity - the <tt>EventDeserializer</tt>
interface.) <p>

The <span class="khaki">khaki</span> boxes show implementation classes
discovered by the SPI mechanism. These are, therefore, the real
plug-ins. The picture shows only those that are distributed as a part
of the Soaplab2 package - but they may be others, from other projects
(after all, that's why it is called a plug-in mechanism, isn't
it). <p>

The <span class="cyan">cyan</span> boxes are the core of extending by
"naming a class". The focus points here are interfaces
<tt>AnalysisService</tt> and <tt>AnalysisListService</tt> - they
represents what the end-users (Soaplab2 clients) really see, and what
functionality they may expect from Soaplab2. They are instantiated by
the "Protocol layer": depending on the protocol used, they can handle
different Web Service protocols. <p>

The <tt>Job</tt> interface is the place where the major work
happens. For example, there is a class (inheriting from the
<tt>AbstractJob</tt>) representing command-line tools (aka AppLab),
and another class representing not-that-old Gowlab. <p>

<div class="highlight">
Architecture guided tour
</div>
<p>

The requests from clients come using a particular protocol. Because
Soaplab2 was designed to be primarily a Web service, the usual
protocol is SOAP/HTTP. But even this protocol can be supported by
various Java toolkits, such as <em>JAX-WS</em> or <em>Apache
Axis</em>. Also, other protocols can be added without changing the
rest of the picture (HTML REST jumps into mind first). There are few
things dependent on the chosen protocol (e.g. how to find under which
name a service was invoked, what is the <em>service name</em> that the
client used) - those are accessible through the <a
href="API/org/soaplab/services/protocol/ProtocolToolkit.html"><tt>org.soaplab.services.protocol.ProtocolToolkit</tt></a>
interface. Therefore, each Soaplab2 service is represented by a class
implementing the <a
href="API/org/soaplab/share/Analysis.html"><tt>org.soaplab.share.Analysis</tt></a>
interface and the
<tt>org.soaplab.services.protocol.ProtocolToolkit</tt> interface. <p>

<a name="new-protocol"></a>
<u>What to do in order to add a new protocol?</u> <p>

First, you need a class that understands how to interpret (read,
un-marshal) incoming requests, and how to create (write, marshal)
results, both complying with the chosen protocol. This class also
needs to provide all functionality defined in the <a
href="API/org/soaplab/share/Analysis.html"><tt>org.soaplab.share.Analysis</tt></a>
interface. <p>

The usual way to achieve this is to sub-class the class
<tt>org.soaplab.services.AnalysisService</tt>. An example of that can
be found in
<tt>org.soaplab.services.protocol.jaxws.AnalysisService</tt>, a class
used for the <em>JAX-WS</em> toolkit. Another example (using rather
delegation pattern than a direct inheritance) is in
<tt>org.soaplab.services.protocol.axis1.AnalysisService</tt>. <p>

Second, you need to <em>deploy</em> your new class (or classes) in
order to be recognised by your Web server. Which usually mean to
specify your class name in some, protocol/toolkit specific
configuration file. Soaplab2 provides support for <em>JAX-WS</em> and,
for backward compatibility with Soaplab1, the old <em>Apache
Axis</em>. Both protocols have own Ant task that does the deployment:

<pre class="script">
ant jaxdeploy
ant axis1deploy
</pre>

More details about deployment is in the section for service
providers.<p>


<u>What is actually available to the clients?</u> <p>

Soaplab2 core functionality can be expressed by two interfaces: the <a
href="API/org/soaplab/share/Analysis.html">Analysis</a> interface and
the <a href="API/org/soaplab/share/AnalysisList.html">AnalysisList</a>
interface. The former one can be also extended by type-safe interface
of so-called <em>derived services</em> (not yet implemented, not shown
in the picture). <p>

The <tt>AnalysisList</tt> interface is implemented by the
<tt>AnalysisListService</tt> class (or by its sub-classes, depending
on which protocol is used) which uses an
<tt>AnalysisInventoryProvider</tt> to get a list of provided
services. The inventory provider relies on the SPI mechanism to get
one or more lists (it merges them together). The default provider
reads the lists of available services from XML files. An
explanation how to add your own list, possibly in another format, is
<a href="#spi_analysisinventory">below</a>. <p>

The <tt>AnalysisService</tt> class uses the same lists each time a
service request comes in order to check whether such service is still
available. It allows to add or remove new services on-the-fly, without
restarting your servlet engine. Just by editing the XML file with a
list of available services makes it happen. <p>

<div class="note">

Well, this is correct for the <em>JAX-WS</em> implementation (which is
supposed to be the most usual one). For Axis-1 protocol, however, it
is not enough. A full deployment Ant's task must be run every time you
add a new service.

</div>

<u>Service metadata</u> <p>

Each service needs metadata. It accesses them using the <a
href="API/org/soaplab/services/metadata/MetadataAccessor.html"><tt>MetadataAccessor</tt></a>
interface. A default implementation of this interface is the class
<tt>org.soaplab.services.metadata.MetadataAccessorXML</tt> that reads
it, as the name suggests, from the XML files. Instances of this class
are created by the factory, and this factory can be replaced by the
SPI plug-in. Details how to make a service reading its metadata from a
different source are <a href="#spi_metadatafactory">below</a>. <p>

<a name="jobs"></a>
<u>Jobs - The main <em>raison d'etre</em> of each service</u> <p>

When a service gets a request to really do something (like starting a
command-line analysis, fetching a web page, or submitting a task to a
grid infrastructure) it asks <tt>JobManager</tt> to create an instance
of a <tt>Job</tt>. Some related requests share, however, the same Job
instance (typically, for example, one invocation of a command-line
analysis is one Job, but it can contain more requests, such as
starting the job, asking for its status, and requesting its
results). <p>

For each job, the job manager creates a <tt>Reporter</tt>, an
inter-mediator between jobs and their results and states, and an
<tt>EventManager</tt>, another inter-mediator connecting job events
with their listeners. <p>

The ultimate worker, however, is the Job. Each service can have its
own class implementing the <a
href="API/org/soaplab/services/Job.html"><tt>Job</tt></a> interface,
but usually a whole group of services use the same Job class. The name
of this class is taken from service metadata, or from service list
metadata (it is called there a <em>module</em> - which should not be
confused with <em>service category</em> that rather classifies
services semantically). <p>

Soaplab2 provides a convenient parent for Jobs, an <a
href="API/org/soaplab/services/AbstractJob.html"><tt>AbstractJob</tt></a>,
or - for jobs dealing with command-line tools - a <a
href="API/org/soaplab/services/cmdline/CmdLineJob.html"><tt>CmdLineJob</tt></a>. These
classes do most of the job, except the <tt>run</tt> method. They
should be sub-classed whenever implementing a new Job. <p>

Once again: writing a Job implementation is the most powerful way how
to extend Soaplab2. All the SPI plug-ins and other classes are here to
allow <em>tweaking</em> but new Jobs really do new things. <p>

<u>And the rest...</u> <p>

Remaining pieces of Soaplab2 infrastructure take care about storing
persistently analysis results (see <a
href="#spi_persistentstorage">below</a> the SPI PersistentStorage
plug-in) and about propagating job events to interested listeners (see
<a href="#spi_eventlistener">below</a> the SPI EventListener
plug-in). <p>


<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

<a name="spi_plugins"></a>
<h2>Details on SPI-based plug-ins</h2>


<a name="spi_analysisinventory"></a>
  <h3>AnalysisInventory</h3>

The <a
href="API/org/soaplab/services/AnalysisInventory.html"><tt>AnalysisInventory</tt></a>
interface allows to add new lists of available services. <p>

It is not, however, needed for cases when a list of services is
split across more than one file - such case can be already handled by
the <tt>org.soaplab.services.DefaultAnalysisInventory</tt> class. This
class reads list of available analyses (services) from an XML file
whose name is given in a property <tt>applist</tt> (see more about
configuration properties in the <a
href="ConfigurationGuide.html">Configuration Guide</a>). The
<tt>applist</tt> property, can actually contain more than one file
name (or, the same property can be used several times, with several
different file names). <p>

Therefore, use this SPI plug-in, and create your own class
implementing the <tt>org.soaplab.services.AnalysisInventory</tt>
interface, when you have a list of services in a different format, or
if you wish to keep it in a different kind of storage (such as a
database). <p>

The <tt>AnalysisInventory</tt> interface allows to identify each list
by adding a (reasonably) unique identifier to it, called a <em>list
authority</em>. If not empty, the list authority becomes part of the
service name. <p>

<a name="standard-list"></a>
<u>Standard format of an analysis list</u> <p>

The class <tt>org.soaplab.services.DefaultAnalysisInventory</tt>
understands lists in XML format that follow the <a
href="SoaplabList.dtd">SoaplabList.dtd</a> where:

<dl>
  <dt class="highlight">category</dt>
  <dd> Is a group of semantically related services.<p>

  <dt class="highlight">app</dt>
  <dd> Is a service (an analysis) that belongs to a category.
       <div class="inote">
       
       To Be Done: I still need to find how to express that a service
can belong to more than one category.

       </div>

  <dt class="highlight">name</dt>
  <dd> A name (unique within category) of this service/analysis. <p>
       
  <dt class="highlight">xml</dt>
  <dd> A name of an XML file with service metadata. More about service
metadata <a href="#spi_metadatafactory">elsewhere</a>.
       <div class="inote">
       
       To Be Done: I still need to find how to express when service
metadata are not in a file but, for example, in a relation database.

       </div>
       
  <dt class="highlight">module</dt>
  <dd> Is a class name that represents a Job for this service. More
about Jobs <a href="#jobs">here</a>. Or it is a synonym for a class
name. For example, all services fetching web pages have module
<em>gowlab</em>, and all services starting command-line analyses have
module <em>sowa</em> (which, by the way, means, historically, "SOaplab
Without Applab"). <p>

       If it is missing, the <em>module</em> attribute is looked for
in the individual service metadata. If neither there can be found, the
default synonym <em>sowa</em> is used. <p>
       
  <dt class="highlight">desc</dt>
  <dd> Is a short, often just one-line, description of this
service. The more detailed description can be put in the individual
service metadata.
       
</dl>
<p>

An example of such list is in
<tt>&lt;soaplab-home&gt;/metadata/DefaultApplications.xml</tt>. <p>


<a name="spi_metadatafactory"></a>
  <h3> MetadataAccessorFactory</h3>

Again, as have been said above: Each service needs metadata. When you
are developing a Job class you can access metadata through <a
href="API/org/soaplab/services/metadata/MetadataAccessor.html"><tt>MetadataAccessor</tt></a>
interface. Description what you can get from it, however, requires a
separate guide (<em>not yet written</em>). This SPI plug-in is more
about how to allow each service to read its metadata in its own format
and from its own resource. <p>

The SPI plug-in mechanism is usually used to bring together more
classes implementing the given interface. In this case, however, only
one class is used (and if there are more found only the first one is
used). This class is a factory, implementing interface <a
href="API/org/soaplab/services/metadata/DefaultMetadataAccessorFactory.html"><tt>MetadataAccessorFactory</tt></a>
with only one method - <tt>getInstance(String serviceName)</tt> - that
returns a metadata accessor for the given service. <p>

The default implementation is class
<tt>org.soaplab.services.metadata.DefaultMetadataAccessorFactory</tt>
that finds service metadata in the service list (see the <em>xml</em>
attribute in the <a href="#standard-list">standard list format</a>),
or in the configuration properties "metadata.dir" and/or
".metadata.file" (see details in <a
href="ConfigurationGuide.html">Configuration guide</a>). In fact, this
class just delegates the task to the <tt>MetadataAccessorXML</tt> but
that is only an implementation detail. <p>


<a name="spi_eventlistener"></a>
  <h3> EventListener and EventDeserializer</h3>

A running job changes its state and the user may be interested in
being notified about these changes. A prominent change in the job
lifecycle is, of course, when the job terminates (either by an error
or by a user request or by its own nature). <p>

There are two mechanisms how to deliver such notifications:
<em>client-pull</em> or <em>server-push</em>. They differ in a way how
the events are being exchanged but both share the same format of the
events themselves. <p>

From the Soaplab2 infrastructure perspective, both delivery and - up
to certain extent - format of events are hidden in individual
<em>event listeners</em>. An Event Listener is a class implementing
the <a
href="API/org/soaplab/services/events/EventListener.html"><tt>EventListener</tt></a>
interface. Any number of such listeners can be added using the SPI
plug-in mechanism. (There are, for example, plans to have a listener
in the Soaplab2 GUI - called Dashboard - that will display events
coming from all jobs as HTML pages.) <p>

If you implement your own event listener you decide which events to
listen to. The interface assumes several default event types (of
course, you are free to ignore any of them) - but they can be
extended. If you do so, you also need to write a class that can
convert these new events from their XML representation back to their
Java instances. Such <em>deserializer</em> is added to the system by
another SPI plug-in point - an interface <a
href="API/org/soaplab/services/events/EventDeserializer.html"><tt>EventDeserializer</tt></a>
(this plug-in is not shown in the Architecture picture above). Where
is then event <em>serializer</em>? Well, it is part of the <a
href="API/org/soaplab/services/events/EventListener.html"><tt>EventListener</tt></a>
interface - see there method <tt>toXML()</tt>. <p>

<u>Existing event types</u> <p>

<img src="images/AnalysisEvent.jpg" border=0 align="left"/>

The picture is taken from the standard <a
href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/lsae.htm">Life
Sciences Analysis Engine</a> specification which Soaplab2
follows. Only the names of Java classes representing individual events
are more Java-like (e.g. the main event is the class <a
href="API/org/soaplab/services/events/AnalysisEvent.html"><tt>AnalysisEvent</tt></a>). <p>

The XML representation of the events follows the <a
href="AnalysisEvent.dtd">AnalysisEvent.dtd</a>. <p>

The details of individual events are described in their <a
href="API/org/soaplab/services/events/package-summary.html">API</a>. <p>

<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

You can see (static) examples of all standard events by running:

<pre class="script">
build/run/run-any-client org.soaplab.services.testing.TestEvents
</pre>
<p>

The default event listener provided by Soaplab2 is class
<tt>org.soaplab.services.events.DefaultEventListener</tt> that simply
records events into a log file. For example:

<pre class="sscript">

The <a href="ConfigurationGuide.html">Configuration Guide</a> has some
details how it can be configured. <p>


<a name="spi_persistentstorage"></a>
  <h3> PersistentStorage</h3>

This SPI plug-in allows to deal with the analysis results. Primarily
meant to store them and retrieve on request later, it can also play a
role of the result visualisers. The interface <a
href="API/org/soaplab/services/storage/PersistentStorage.html"><tt>PersistentStorage</tt></a>
has a boolean method <tt>isSink()</tt>. When it returns <em>true</em>
the methods retrieving results are supposed to return nothing -
exactly what a visualiser would do. <p>

The default storage is in a local file system, implementing by the
class <tt>org.soaplab.services.storage.FileStorage</tt>. A database
storage is going to be added soon. <p>

The existing contents and cleaning can be done by a command-line
program <tt>ExploreStorage</tt>. For details, see <a
href="AdminTools.html">Administration Tools</a>, or start the on-line
help by typing:

<pre class="script">
build/run/run-any-client org.soaplab.admin.ExploreStorage -help
</pre>

<p>



<a name="class_plugins"></a>
<h2>Details on classes-based plug-ins</h2>

Several places can be extended by developer's own classes. Their names
are (usually) in service metadata. A developer needs:

<ul>
  <li class="tiny"> to implement a correct interface,
  <li class="tiny"> to put new class (or classes) on the CLASSPATH
together with other Soaplab2 classes, and
  <li class="tiny"> to put the name of the implementing class on a
proper place in service metadata.
</ul> <p>

The best practise is to extend an existing class rather than develop
from the scratch. See examples below. <p>


<a name="class_job"></a>
  <h3>Job - <a href="API/org/soaplab/services/Job.html"><tt>org.soaplab.services.Job</tt></a></h3>

The most crucial extension. It brings the whole new functionality to a
service or to a group of services. <p>

A full example of such class-based plug-in is a Job that submits tasks
to a computational grid. It is represented by the class
<tt>org.bioinfogrid.services.GridJob</tt>. This project is in a
separate CVS module <span class="highlight">bioinfogrid-plugin</span>
(in the same repository as Soaplab2, at SourceForge). <p>

When writing a new Job implementation, consider to inherit either from
the <a
href="API/org/soaplab/services/AbstractJob.html"><tt>AbstractJob</tt></a>
or from the <a
href="API/org/soaplab/services/cmdline/CmdLineJob.html"><tt>CmdLineJob</tt></a>. <p>


<a name="class_data"></a>
  <h3>Input/Result - <a
href="API/org/soaplab/services/adaptor/DataAdaptor.html"><tt>org.soaplab.services.adaptor.DataAdaptor</tt></a></h3>

<em>Yet to be written... for now, check the API</em><p>


<a name="class_parameter"></a>
  <h3>Parameter - <a href="API/org/soaplab/services/cmdline/Parameter.html"><tt>org.soaplab.services.cmdline.Parameter</tt></a></h3>

<em>Yet to be written... for now, check the API</em><p>
<p>

<a name="junit"></a>
<h2>JUnit testing</h2>

For junit testing, there is an Ant's task <tt>test-junit</tt>:

<pre class="script">
ant test-junit
</pre>

The tests included in this junit testing task are all Java sources
defined in the directory tree within <tt>src/test/java/</tt> that
contain "Test" in their names. <p>

The <tt>test-junit</tt> task compiles test classes and run the
tests. The tests reports are stored in the directory
<tt>test-reports</tt>. <p>

Soaplab2 uses junit version 4 (and above). The corresponding
<tt>junit.jar</tt> is downloaded by usual maven procedure (as any
other dependencies) and stored in your local maven
repository. However, it may not be (yet) visible to the testing
tasks. If that happens, the following message (and instructions what
to do) are being displayed:

<pre class="script">
ant test-junit
...
junit-present:
     [echo]
     [echo] ================================= WARNING ================================
     [echo] Junit library is not present in a correct directory. Tests not executed.
     [echo] The library (junit.jar) is, however, in your local Maven repository.
     [echo] Therefore:
     [echo]     Put it in your ${ANT_HOME}/lib directory.
     [echo]     Or, put in your ${HOME}/.ant/lib directory.
     [echo]     Or start ant with -lib &lt;your junit library&gt;.
     [echo] ==========================================================================
     [echo]
</pre>

Sometimes it is more convenient to run only some tests (because the
other tests may take too long). It can be done by compiling first the
test classes (by the Ant's task <tt>compile-tests</tt>) and running a
script with the name of the class containing the wanted tests. For
example:

<pre class="script">
ant compile-tests
build/run/run-junit-test org.soaplab.clients.RepeatabilityTests
JUnit version 4.3.1
.
Time: 1.352

OK (1 test)
</pre>
