	third-party library from a Maven repository).

2008-01-29  Mahmut Uludag  <uludag&#64;ebi.ac.uk>

    * Added:
      - directory locks when reading and loading job properties files

        iterating over the jobs list

2007-12-06  Martin Senger  <martin.senger&#64;gmail.com>

	* Fixed: External programs started from/by Soaplab get now updated
	version of the environmental variable PATH (which is, for example,
	a requirement for such programs as EMBOSS's wossname).

2007-12-05  Martin Senger  <martin.senger&#64;gmail.com>

	* Fixed: better support for the 'toggle' attribute in the EMBOSS
	ACD files (until now these parameters were displayed as simple
	text field, but they are now correctly shown as boolean radio
	buttons).

2007-12-04  Martin Senger  <martin.senger&#64;gmail.com>

	* Fixed: Result 'report' was truncated when retrieved after a
	while.

2007-11-21  Martin Senger  <martin.senger&#64;gmail.com>

	* Fixed: Soaplab2 running in Tomcat was not properly re-creating
	the (empty) result directory if it was removed (manually) during
	the Tomcat life.

	* Fixed: Some jobs were removed too fast; even when it was not
	wanted; resulting with an unexpected errors "Not Found" later

2007-11-15  Martin Senger  <martin.senger&#64;gmail.com>

	* Added: More service properties are coming in metadata from
	Soaplab2 servers (version, supplier, and most importantly
