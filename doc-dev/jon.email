Subject: ACD meeting date ...


Dear Martin, Peter, Alan

Following from our chat t'other week, can we find a couple of hours in the
week of 3-7 April to meet and discuss future requirements for the ACD syntax.
I can't make the 6th (dentists) and I think the 4th is out too.

The basic idea is to extend ACD to be even more generic so that it's suitable
for defining any non-interactive application, ie. the EMBOSS apps and
everything else.  Then push for it to be taken up as a community standard.
Should be easy ... :)

Presumably ACD couldn't cope with everything that SOAPLAB needed to call;
those cases seem a good a place to start as any.

Given that we'll eventually need an XML schema to describe everything that
might occur in an ACD file, we may as well also think about provenance info
that could sensibly be put in an ACD file, e.g. EMBOSS version number,
application version number, etc.  I guess most of the provenance info would
go in the application output though.

Might also be worth thinking whether there are other data, currently on the
EMBOSS website or documentation and e.g. hardcoded into SOAPLAB, which could
also be provided in XML - but not necessarily in the ACD-XML schema. The basic
idea to facillitate other developers / programmatic interfaces to the EMBOSS
apps.  I dunno, maybe a list of supported sequence database formats, tables of
correspondence for database abbreviationss, sequence attributes etc would be
valuable.

Also, a web-based or stand-alone ACD file generator.  We could talk about
whether the SOAPLAP dashboard (or bits of same) could be re-used, or whether
something from scratch is needed.

If other things occur, please let me know and I'll work out a proper agenda
for the meeting.

I'd sooner keep this meeting small - but can pull in other local people once
we've got an agenda - and external groups in subsequent meetings.

Occurs to me that if I could do some of this over the next year .. and your
(Martin) 1-year revision to SOAPLAB could use some of it, then we have a nice
basis for collaboration / little paper between the two sites.

What d'ya think ?

Cheers

Jon
